  <p>We are a business and advisory firm that markets professional services to organizations.  SRI brings together consultants with over 100 years of teaching, researching, management coaching, and advisory experience across a variety of industries and settings. Our goal is to help clients succeed, not to generate more projects and revenue.</p>
  <p>We’ve worked with everyone from new, private startups to very large, complex, and publicly held corporations facing complex and dynamic challenges to their competitive position, value proposition, internal processes, and financial performance. We’ve also worked with a number of public entities and not-for profits. We work well within a variety of business models, revenue structures, and legal forms. </p>
  <p>We don’t just write reports that look good and employ lots of buzzwords. We know that a solid analysis that drives a well-implemented plan beats highly abstract and academic plans that fail to account for a variety of assets, capabilities, and cultures. </p>
