    <p>Good decisions are the result of experience.  Experience is the result of bad decisions.</p>

    <p>2020 has been a year like no other! Organizational leaders continue to face an unprecedented decision environment as the first half of the year ends. Teams have had no playbook to consult for guidance in handling the Coronavirus economic hard-stop, and the now lurching restart. The current focus on racial injustice also raises difficult questions for leaders and it generates pressure for lasting change. Looking back 6 months, some decisions have been good, and others have yielded "experience;" however, most teams lack the time and energy to catch their breath.  Teams need to cull out the important lessons from this frenzied time and decide what to start, what to stop, and what to keep doing for a profitable 2021.</p>

    <p>We can help. Learning that leverages 2020's lessons happens when leaders carve out dedicated time and space for their team to explore, catalog, and reflect on past actions and determine what worked and what didn’t. We provide skilled and objective facilitators and a  structured workshop format that helps senior teams brings their most important decisions and issues to the surface. Our process ensures that the work leads to actionable outcomes. We know that deep reflection, and the learning that leads to wisdom, is some of the hardest work executive teams will ever do; however, the enlightenment they gain helps turn their past experiences into better future decisions.</p>

    <p>Our facilitators help create the open, honest, and trust-filled environment needed for your team to critically assess recent and current decisions and actions.  This enables the deep learning that improves future business performance.  Our work begins with a rigorous assessment of your strategic position, and the key assets and processes that drive your competitive advantage.  We facilitate a workshop that reviews important recent decisions and actions for their impact on strategy.  We then help your team turn this knowledge into the wisdom that will enhance future effectiveness.  As the process ends, your team will have an actionable plan for success that includes the dates and dollars the hold people accountable.</p>

    <p>Companies should recalibrate strategy now in order to:</p>
    <ul>• Prepare for a world that will continue to require flexible and adaptive actions.</ul>
    <ul>• Anticipate and respond to the competitive challenges of societal mega-trends.</ul>
    <ul>• Engage the entire organization in strategy and its execution.</ul>
    <ul>• Develop a resilient culture capable of continuous learning.</ul>
