Mitsubishi Compressor Corporation (MCC) is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of Japan’s largest conglomerates. MCC produces and sells compressors for the Oil and Gas market. It takes pressure to move Oil or Natural Gas to the surface, to move it along miles (sometimes hundreds) of pipelines from the field the refinery, and to move oil through the refining process. Compressors are complex marvels of engineering, and the sale of compressor can help a company generate follow-on sales of replacement parts and service contracts.

The industry featured some of the world’s best manufacturing companies, including General Electric (GE), Dresser Rand, Siemens Corporation, Mitsubishi. The landscape of the industry changed dramatically when Siemens merged with Dresser Rand in 2015 and GE bought Baker Hughes—a well-healed market leader—in 2017. Mitsubishi now faced competitors with potentially greater scale, market reach, and internal cash flows to finance new projects. As a smaller player in a consolidated industry, MCC faced substantial strategic risk from its competitors. MCC needed help.

Our teams began with a deep dive into each of the new behemoths. How would the combination of these companies make them better? For GE, the purchase of Baker Hughes represented a big bet to build market share in the Oil and Gas industry. At the time, this looked like a substantial growth market that would be a great portfolio addition to an old-line, high quality manufacturing company. Siemens was looking to increase its share in the US market, and Dresser Rand offered them an opportunity to gain share quickly.

As we dug deeper, we found that the benefits these two mergers hoped to bring about weren’t forthcoming. GE, besides being a talented manufacturer, was new to the industry, and the challenge lay in digesting the smaller, nimbler Baker Hughes into a huge bureaucracy. The challenge of integration meant that both companies would be focused internally, and not on the market itself. Siemens had overpaid for Dresser Rand and had proved unable to generate the kinds of synergies that would allow them to earn a return on a huge investment.

Our teams provided MCC’s leadership steam with a clear and objective view of the new competitive environment, one that went behind the press releases or articles in the business press. Our ability to do in-depth interviews with many in the industry gave us insights on the situation that showed significant opportunities for MCC, as well as real threats. Our leadership team continued to monitor the situation after the engagement ended, and we have provided MCC with periodic updates of the situation.

Consolidation, or fragmentation, in an industry changes the competitive landscape in some obvious and some subtle ways. It can seem to executives that consolidation comes “out of the blue,” but understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your competition, and your own company, can help you create scenarios and plans for consolidation or fragmentation. For MCC, as for many smaller players in an industry, changes in the competitive landscape often bring as many opportunities for growth as they do threats to survival.
