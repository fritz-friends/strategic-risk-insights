I was reading a speech given at my university in the summer of 2010. Remember 2010? The unemployment rate during the summer of 2010 was 9.6 percent and mortgage rates had fallen from 5% to 4.65%. Today, unemployment stands at 13.3%--with hearty debate about exactly what’s behind that number—and you can get a mortgage refi for somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.125%. Today makes the recession of 2010 seem like the good old days! The speaker made the point that the only certainty in 2010 was uncertainty, around the depth and length of the recession.

Uncertainty abounds about the state of Coronavirus. Politicians and pundits argue about whether the spike in cases in the US represents a “second wave,” and new cases in Beijing provide fresh evidence that the virus has not been eradicated at its origin. Everything from the opening of elementary schools to the status of the National Football league is unclear.

The only certainty being uncertainty mirrors another common phrase we often hear: the only constant is change. It turns out that both statements, while having elements of truth, don’t really reflect the situations we find ourselves in. There are things we can be certain about today, and even in the midst of change it’s remarkable how much remains stable. If we understand the things that remain stable, the true ports in any storm, we can leverage those to help our organizations move forward in meaningful ways. Let me highlight three of these ports you can employ in the coming weeks.

**The value of values**

Values reflect what we care about most deeply. Some people mistakenly believe that when we are in the cauldron of uncertainty our best selves will emerge. What really comes out is who we really are, or what our deepest values are. Values help us prioritize actions based on the criteria of what’s best rather than what’s easiest. All companies responded to the Coronacrisis, and the current realities of systemic racism, by going to their deepest values. Whether we think an organization responded well or not, we’ve all learned much about the deep values that drive companies we do business with.

With 90 days experience under your belt, take a step back this week and match your actions in the last three months to your espoused values. Those are the ones on your walls and in your mission statement. How tightly did your actions align with your values? If they match up, then your espoused values are your lived ones. If there’s a mismatch between what you did and what you proclaim, then your espoused values are aspirational, but not actual.

**Bottom Line**: Your lived values will endure and guide your decision making, so if you’re not happy with where you are, change your values first.

**The power of autonomy**

Autonomy is our ability to control our own future. Autonomy doesn’t mean pure independence; we sill have to rely on others. No leader or organization is independent. Autonomy means that we’re interdependent with, but not dependent on, others. To the extent that we are dependent, or controlled by others, we lack autonomy. The best place to see this is your balance sheet, and the difference between the asset of cash and the liability of debt.

Cash is king in any crisis. As of today, total assets in money-market funds—the most liquid investment—is at $4.6 Trillion, up 30% in six months. The previous high? $3.8 Trillion during the 2008 financial crisis. Cash gives your business the flexibility to continue to fund critical assets, like your employees, and project that will enhance your strategic advantage.

**Bottom line:** Make sure your cash, and access to it, is sufficient to meet your needs for the next several months. Think about autonomy in non-cash terms as well, such as diversifying your customer or supplier base.

**The wisdom of delay**

The world we live in today values speed, and we all believe the spoils go to those who move first. There is a strong logic behind the notion of first-mover advantage, but that’s not always true. If you play golf, you understand the value of putting behind someone with a similar lie—you get to “go to school” off of them. Sometimes, and this is one of those times, the value of being second, or third, and the learning that it enables, beats the potential advantages of moving first. Right now you want to follow others, particularly your local health department, and only lead out when there are clear advantages.

Take one of the burning questions of the day: Will I allow my employees to work from home after the crisis ends? Several companies have already staked out a clear position of yes, and there are some compelling advantages. After 90 days, however, some deeper questions emerge that advise caution and avoiding a rush to action. How will working from home affect the onboarding process? What will career paths look like for a remote workforce? How will cultural norms and our collective identity change as we no longer shake hands and rub shoulders?

**Bottom line:** the old adage “measure twice, cut once” applies here. Avoid quick actions that bind you to certain courses of action. Wait and learn from others—in this situation don’t act until you have to.
