This is an interesting and critical week in our coronavirus journey. Case counts are spiking, and it looks like the South and West regions of the country will experience what the Northeast saw in March. Texas is putting its reopening process “on hold” and other states are implementing new restrictions to slow the spread of the Virus. Uncertainty is alive and well, and the next month will be telling on many accounts.

In a conversation with a former student, we discussed the challenges their companies are facing right now. We talked about everything: from how to triage a balance sheet to reimagining the post-coronavirus office. She said: “I know how to manage through our current situation, but how do I lead?” Technology gives us a number of tools to manage projects and workflows, but the lack of human contact with our teams has brought into sharp relief the problem of leadership: how do we comfort, develop, inspire, and nurture our teams and organizations?

Peter Drucker first highlighted the difference between these two activities; management is about doing things right~~,~~ efficiency in production, and quality in output. Management is all about product. Leadership is doing the right thing, effectiveness in action, and quality in organization. Leadership is all about purpose. Products are objective and concrete, purpose is subjective and abstract. We can get things done right without asking whether they’re worth doing at all. Let me suggest two areas to focus on as you lead through these turbulent times: bringing organization out of chaos and creating faith in the organization.

**Organizing Chaos**

We see chaos everywhere around us. Coronavirus cases continue to climb nationwide, at alarming rates in some states. New jobless claims seem to be tapering off, but the specter of a second round of lockdown creates chaos for families and firms trying to think about the future. Management and its focus on tasks can help create order out of chaos. We can make plans and understand important sequences and critical paths. This works fine for today, but what might tomorrow bring We need more than order.

Organizing chaos doesn’t mean ordering or controlling it. Organizing means understanding it, and the forces that drive it, and working to leverage those drivers to work in our favor. If creating order means giving clear instructions, organizing chaos requires clear and unimpeded listening. Order means sequencing actions, organization requires understanding how different moves interact with each other, and where they may cause rebounds and ripple effects. Order is about getting the hand-off right between people, organization is about getting all hands involved. Order is about rigidity; organization is about flexibility and adaptability.

**Bottom line**: If you want to manage, talk to you your teams, if you want to lead, listen to them. Try and remain flexible in making commitments, and those you make should be geared around the long-term health and viability of your business. As uncertainty rises, your willingness to be flexible and adapt should rise in tandem.

**Creating Faith**

Back in the 1930s, in the midst of an economic depression that wouldn’t end, Chester Barnard, then President of New Jersey Bell, gave a series of lectures at Harvard on the topic of management, organization and leadership. In his last lecture, he spoke of the need for moral leadership by those at the top. He said that moral leadership entailed the creation of faith: “faith in the common understanding, faith in the probability of success, faith in the ultimate satisfaction of personal motives, faith the in the integrity of \[ ] authority, faith in the superiority of the common purpose as a personal aim of those who partake in it.”

Management is, at its essence, a technical art. Managers inspire faith because they help people understand how to solve problems, break through barriers, and create successful outcomes. It’s the world of What to do and How to do it. Leadership, as Barnard notes, is at its essence a spiritual and emotional art. Leaders inspire faith when they help people connect their work to larger ends; success for the organization means success for employees, but also for other key stakeholders such as customers, investors, and communities. Leadership is all about the Why something is worth doing in the first place.

Leadership may be about faith and inspiration, but it also requires a level of honesty and integrity that extends beyond mere management. Managers care about getting today’s work done and will often sidestep questions about the health of the business lest that slow productivity. Leaders, on the other hand, talk openly about the long-term viability of the company and honestly address concerns. They help people connect todays productivity with objectives that extend beyond survival.

**Bottom line:** to lead more effectively right now, carve out time in every on-line meeting to help your team see where they are today in terms of the organizations, and their own, long term objectives. Be open about real challenges, but also communicate hope and faith that things will work out well. If you abandon that hope, your teams will see their own faith in the future decline.
