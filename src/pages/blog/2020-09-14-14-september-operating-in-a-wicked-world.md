This week’s post goes deeper into the topic of operating in a wicked world. This is NOT a post about morality or behavior, but builds on a definition of wickedness advanced by psychologists Emre Soyer and Robin Hogarth. They define a wicked world as one that does not play fair, where data comes at us randomly, not well ordered, incomplete, inconsistent, and often indirect. Feedback, the link between cause and effect that we talked about last week, is slow in coming, messy and unclear, and may often mislead us about the real relationships in play.

They contrast a wicked world, or in their term Decision Environment, with a kind one. In a kind world, information is clear, well ordered, sequenced, complete, and consistent. Feedback is clear and timely. That’s the decision environment we all love to live in. It allows us to experiment with new products or processes and see the effects of these changes. Most of what you learned, and I teach, in business school works best in a kind world; however, applying those same tools in a wicked world leads to poor and perverse results. Let’s discuss how to make good decisions in a wicked world, based on the two major notions of difficult data and fuzzy feedback.

**Dealing with difficult data**

The first technique for dealing with the type of data and information that characterize a wicked work is to favor primary data over secondary data. Primary data is that which you collect yourself, through interviews, observations, or direct experience. Secondary data is that which you get from someone else, be it a government agency or market research firm. Primary data is rich in nuance and context, secondary data filters most of that out. In a wicked environment, nuance and context help you sort out what’s really happening, what is specific truth (to a context), and what is generalizable. Primary data is also immediate—collected in the here and now—while secondary data is delayed and appears according to some arbitrary criteria, such as a week or month. In a wicked world, knowing what’s happening now allows you to track trends more effectively.

The second technique is an old scientific staple: Triangulation. Gather your data from multiple sources, but also from stakeholders with different perspectives on the same issue at hand. For example, if you want to know the current state of retail, talk to shop owners and customers (this is a no-brainer), but also landlords and suppliers. Each stakeholder focuses on a different aspect of the retail ecosystem, and when you combine that data, you’ll more readily see clarity amidst ambiguity, and consistent themes will usually emerge.

**Bottom line:** Hand collected, primary data from multiple perspectives will yield more “truth” than abstract, delayed data from single sources.

**Fuzzy Feedback**

Let’s begin by considering two ways feedback can be fuzzy: there are multiple causes for the same effect, or a single cause brings about multiple effects. In the first case, you’ll get an inconsistent reading on the true nature of cause and effect because while A causes C, so does B. If you see C, but no A, you’ll assume there’s no relationship when there actually is one. The solution? Strength in numbers. If you want to draw conclusions about the link between A and C, multiple observations of the outcome should reveal that A actually does cause C. The best way to get multiple observations is to have constant communication with people who live in environments where C happens with regularity. For executives, this means constant and real contact with sales and support people who are dealing with the market on the ground level. They’ll have a keen sense of what the real, underlying link between A and C. When effects have multiple causes—a key source of fuzzy feedback—you should seek the wisdom of those closest to the effect you want to influence. The goal is depth of knowledge about a single world, of effect C.

What about the reverse, when a single cause has multiple effects? The solution is similar, but the focus is slightly different: gather data, information and wisdom from people who use A in a variety of settings. If salespeople can tell you about the effects of causes on their market, then marketing people, or supply chain experts, can tell you about the different effects they see in their worlds when A gets done. When A hits different contexts, those nuances create unique and variegated effects. It’s not only that A causes C (working from home increases personal productivity and project completion) but that A also causes D (difficulties in onboarding and enculturation), and even E (loss of high-touch customer interactions and brand building). If you want better feedback about A, go broad and look at all the contexts where A will have some impact.

**Bottom Line:** Getting good feedback in a wicked world requires a focus on both depth (to understand what’s causing an effect of interest) and breadth (to know more of the impacts of A throughout the business).

COVID-19 didn’t bring on a wicked world, we were already in the midst of a wicked decision environment. What the pandemic laid bare was the total inadequacy of using tools and techniques that worked in a kind world. Some leaders and their organizations had shifted to “wicked world” information gathering and decision making, and these are the ones who transitioned into the pandemic successfully. If you weren’t in that group, now’s the time to stop being Kind and adapt to thriving in a wicked world
