In their 1994 classic book Built to Last, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras identified one aspect of great companies and their leaders: They avoid the tyranny of the OR and embrace the genius of the AND. The best leaders avoid false tradeoffs, where we do one thing at the expense of another. Tradeoffs are sometimes necessary, and good leaders make the tough choices when they have to. That said, the best leaders refuse to be trapped in the tyranny of the OR and look for ways their organization to accomplish two things that appear to be in conflict.

Since the lockdowns in March, we’ve seen people frame the COVID-19 issue as “public health or economic recovery.” This is a classic example of the tyranny of the OR, because it led to failed policy choices. I’m encouraged this week to see more of the genius of the AND among policy makers. Here’s Fred Kaplan, Dallas Federal Reserve President: “how well we follow the health-care protocols from here is going to be the primary economic tool we have.” That’s the genius of the AND: when people feel comfortable that they will leave home and spend their money. The economy will recover.

In this week’s edition, let’s look at two other instances where the Tyranny of the OR traps and trips up many business leaders today: the illusion that is short-term versus long term, and rapidly opening schools versus safely opening them.

**The Short Term Versus the Long Term**

Consider these two quotes from David Packard, the legendary co-founder of the computer company Hewlett Packard (HP). He frames the long term: “If we continue our dedication to the principles that have carried us through the first 50 years, we will be assured of our continuing success over the next 50 years.” Now, here’s Packard on the criticality of a short-term focus: “It is just as easy to make a profit today as it will be tomorrow. Actions taken which result in reducing short-term profit in the hope of increasing long-term profit are very seldom successful. Such actions are almost always the result of wishful thinking.”

Did you catch the genius of the AND? If not, read again and look for two words that start with P, principles and profits. Principles, those enduring values that are the bedrock of any company’s culture and competitive advantage, create the long-term platform for success, but profit is the appropriate focus for short-term action. The tyranny of the OR comes when we believe that principles have a limited shelf-life and should be bent and molded to fit immediate situational needs, or when profit is some long-term objective, something we’ll see down the road but not today. The genius of the AND: matching the right P with the right time frame. Leaders that focus on profits within the bounds of principles do very well.

**Bottom line**: Be clear about which principles guide your organization over the long term. Make sure that short-term actions are both profitable and consistent with those deeply held values. Principle without profit is an empty victory, but profit without principle reduces life to mindless transactions.

**Safe Kids Versus Open Schools**

This very tyrannical OR is the latest version of faulty Coronavirus trade-offs: public health or economic recovery. The logic runs like this: Economic recovery depends on people (including parents) getting back to work, earning wages, and making purchases. However, parents can’t work without childcare. They shouldn’t leave their kids alone. Schools, public or private, provide are the best solution: children are supervised, and they are educated and prepared for their future. So, the win-win is to have parents at work and kids at school.

No one disagrees with this logic; the complication comes when we ask the question “but what if the school isn’t safe, either in terms of the child becoming ill or the child transmitting the virus to at-risk people such as older teachers, neighbors, or grandparents?” In this case, the tyranny of the OR presents parents with a Faustian bargain: Earn money or protect your kids and other. When faced with this tradeoff, some parents will quit their job no matter the cost. More parents, however, will trudge off to work, but their productivity will be dampened by two very negative emotions: resentment at being ruled by the tyranny of the OR, and/ or extreme worry that distracts them from productive work.

The genius of the AND here is to realize the importance of safety in the productivity equation: It’s not safety or productivity, it has to be safety and productivity. For executives, the genius of the AND is to realize that giving employees flexibility and the support to manage both challenges (work and parenting) increases, not decreases productivity. That’s easier said than done, but for those who embrace it, they’ll find productivity increases, not decreases. Flexible work schedules may lead to fewer total hours worked, but greater productivity by allowing employees to make their work hours truly productive.

Increased support for childcare, or donations to schools of PPE and other tools to improve safety, look like current expenses but are really capital investments, just in human capital rather than plant or equipment. What most employers spend to provide additional childcare—even if it’s in-home babysitting—increases short term productivity and long-term commitment. Those investments increase current t productivity and reduce long-term turnover costs.

**Bottom Line**: Reframe your view of accommodating parental needs from and expense to an investment in people who want to be productive at work and at home. Your people produce the best ROI you can obtain, over both the long and short term, and providing them with what they need to balance their lives provides economic, social, and moral returns to your firm.



As the weeks roll on, the debate over school opening and childcare will descend into a dialogue of the deaf, overseen by a tyrannical master: The false tradeoff of the OR. Your organization can win if you look for solutions that explode that tradeoff. Find the genius of the AND instead and help your business thrive.
