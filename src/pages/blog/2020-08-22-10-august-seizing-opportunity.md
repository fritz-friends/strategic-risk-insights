My son will be a sophomore at Brigham Young University this coming fall. Each week he gets together with a group of very old friends for an evening of dining and video games. This past week I had a chance to speak with one of his friends, Tyler, whose story inspired this week’s edition. Tyler attends Utah Valley University (UVU) and has been hoping to get into the Flight (pilot training) Program there. It’s usually a multi-year process; the competition is tough enough that it takes multiple tries to get accepted. Flight school is beginning to look a lot like Medical School in that regard.

Tyler told me on Monday that he’d been admitted to the Flight program. The school had sent out an email to all Pre-Flight students informing them that acceptances to the program were down and inviting them to apply early. Tyler applied, was accepted, and now begins working toward a career that he’s always hoped for. His quick thinking saved him at least a year of schooling and will likely provide him with a better education because he’ll be part of a smaller class. For reasons I’ll explain below, Tyler has a better chance of landing a job when he graduates. He won big because he seized an opportunity created when others pulled back because of uncertainty and fear. Let’s look at two elements of today’s opportunities that can benefit your business.

**Crisis means less competition today**

Tyler got into the Flight program because several students chose to either not apply in the first place or to defer admission to next year. Tyler moved ahead when others pulled back. Is your company like Tyler, or like the other students? During the financial crisis a decade ago I participated with several others in a workshop for small business owners in our neighborhood. One of the presenters owned an advertising agency and he gave some interesting advice. He told the audience that the middle of a crisis was the best time to advertise. Why? Because their competitors were all cutting their marketing and advertising budgets to save money, and because smart investments in advertising could garner substantial increases in market share that would otherwise be hard to get.

The Harvard Business School is having the same problem that UVU is having. I read in the Wall Street Journal this past week that admissions are down 20% for fall of 2020. To avoid an exodus of students, Harvard allowed students to defer admission to next year. That means that admission to Harvard just became easier because the competition would be less intense. The same smart people would still apply, just fewer of them. There’s another benefit: scholarships will be easier to get because of fewer applicants. Your business may not be training MBAs, but think about areas where you’ve seen competition pull back, either for customers or financing.

**Bottom Line**: When others pull back, they create space for the wise and thoughtful to enter, and to enter more easily. Identify and work to fill these “competitive vacuums.”

**Crisis means less competition tomorrow**

Tyler won big in today’s marketplace because he shaved at least a year off his program, he’ll have a better shot at financial aid, and he’ll enjoy a smaller cohort that facilitates more in-depth learning. He’ll also win tomorrow. Why? If he graduates on schedule, then he’ll be part of a smaller graduating class competing for the same jobs. When competitors pull back, they create a competitive vacuum in today’s market, and a persistent gap in future ones. The reason that gap persists is an economic principle known as “time compression diseconomies.”

A time compression diseconomy occurs when the passage of time is an important element of any process. Think of a farmer growing corn. Corn has a biological cycle clock that determines how soon the ears will appear, and when they will ripen. The farmer has other inputs he can apply to increase the yield of his crop, but he can’t water twice as much—for example—and cut the time to harvest in half. If W = Water and T = Time, here’s a time compression diseconomy in a nutshell: 2W x ½ T < W x T. There are lots of economic processes subject to time compression diseconomies such as building brand equity, product development, or basic research. Wise leaders understand that time compression diseconomies call for patient investments that take time to mature. They also realize that when those investments do mature, they provide a sustainable competitive advantage for their firm. In order to imitate those sources of value, competing firms need to follow the same investment cycle.

Time matters in Flight School. Some classes have to be taken in sequence, and elements like flying time have daily and weekly limits. What does that mean for Tyler, or MBA graduates two years from now competing with Harvard MBAs for jobs? Put simply, next year’s class, no matter how large or smart they are, can’t catch up and become part of this year’s class. So, Tyler and other MBA students will find themselves competing for (roughly) the same number of jobs, but with far fewer competitors for those same jobs. Advantages gained today will persist and become advantages tomorrow. Your business, much like Tyler, can create a lasting advantage when you seize opportunities today.

**Bottom Line**: Seize opportunities where you find time compression diseconomies in your business. Don’t pull back in those critical areas. Those who fail to keep up will fall permanently behind, while those who continue to invest will maintain, or increase, their lead. You want to be in the latter group.

COVID-19 sent a shock through the world’s economy. There were, and still are, very good reasons for prudence and pulling back, such as preserving cash in uncertain times. Wise business leaders will act prudently, but they’ll also look for pockets of opportunity to exploit. Act where you see reduced competition now, and the potential for reduced competition over the longer term.
