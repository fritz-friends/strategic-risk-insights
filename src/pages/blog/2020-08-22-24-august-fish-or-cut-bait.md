I met with my boss, the Dean, the other day. She had asked to take over a project that had languished for some time, and she told me it was time to fish or cut bait—time to decide to move forward or onward, but time to move. My grandmother, in her own marvelous way, had a bit of a cruder formulation of this great aphorism: Pee or get off the pot. However you express it, it’s true that there’s a time to decide, to consider, and to ponder to make good decisions. Then there’s a time to act. Fish or cut bait is a mindset, a philosophy of action. It recognizes the choosing where and when to fish matters but realizes that until the first cast is made there will be no returns.

As we make the turn into fall, two things become clear: the impacts of the coronavirus such as physical distancing, mask wearing, and a fair degree of social stress are here to stay for the foreseeable future. Large events will not happen—the NFL and Colleges may play (emphasis on may), but in near empty stadiums, conferences and tradeshows will continue to be online and remote. Smart leaders are already thinking about what a socially distanced Christmas party looks like.

This is first of several editions where we’ll talk about the mindsets required to succeed in 2021 and beyond. We’ll start with the most critical one, the bias for action and need for proactivity so eloquently captured in the notion of fish or cut bait. Let’s look at three applications of this mindset.

**Cap Ex decisions**

We know that cash is king, in an acute, but cash on the balance sheet begins to gather dust during a chronic situation. Leaders should now have= a better idea of what revenue streams look like in the new world, and CFOs should be able to forecast cash needs and determine a reasonable reserve. Take that extra money off the shelf and start investing in capital projects, from product development to plant and equipment. Fish or cut bait on investments with a 3-5-year time horizon.

One critical investment area is IT, make sure you’re keeping pace with a market where mobility equals flexibility. Don’t underinvest in cybersecurity. The risk of loss makes investments here very high return. For other projects be sure to increase your hurdle rate to reflect increased short-term risk, but as we noted in a previous edition, companies that fish while others keep their line out of the water will be the winners over the long term.

**Bottom line:** prudent but forward-thinking cap ex investments need to be made. You may not know the exact nature of the future, but don’t drag out the decision-making process for things that look plausible (fish) or fantastical (cut bait). Don’t leave cash idle—begin to invest for the future.

**Growth, business development and corporate development**

I have a good friend who’s an attorney. He noted that most of his clients’ mindset has been “do the minimum work I need to survive; we’ll think about thriving later.” It’s later than you think, but not too late. As the coronavirus tide continues to recede, companies can find assets and talent at bargain basement prices that contribute to strategic strength. A third of small businesses were dissatisfied with the bank they got a PPP loan from, and they’re entertaining offers for new bankers. Clever business development programs can help you gain market share from competitors too fearful or hesitant to respond.

Simon Properties, the nation’s largest mall owner, just bought Brooks Brothers—a high end tenant for its malls—out of bankruptcy. They’re also talking with Amazon about turning anchor stores into delivery warehouses, with customer pick up and returns. Simon sees, correctly, the looming overcapacity in retail real estate and is beginning to fish now. Expect Simon to maintain or extend its leadership position as a mall property manager.

**Bottom line**: The future is now. Great growth options abound, but they require effort and risk-taking today. Focus on building a business portfolio that helps bridge they way to the new future and positions you with assets that enhance performance when that day comes.

**Re-imagine your relationship with your workforce**

Google recently announced that its employees could work remotely until the summer of 2021. While some may see that as a dire forecast for the length of the pandemic, Google’s leaders saw something different. They now know that remote work works—maybe not perfectly but good enough—and they recognized that if they gave their workers a clear time horizon for action, those workers could plan their lives and move forward without distraction. Knowing they wouldn’t return until next summer, employees could sign leases on remote housing, make plans for the upcoming school year, and make personal investments in technology and accessories. Google fished so its employees could fish or cut bait in their own lives.

Training and professional development is the other place to fish, don’t cut bait here. Your business is only as good as your people. Some companies locked down and locked out training and development. After all, why invest in people you might have to furlough? Other companies used the lockdown and a home-bound workforce to expand training and development. They are now cutting bait and finding themselves further behind in the race for talent. My wife’s employer decided to fish, and they trained their people during the downtime. They retained their staff, and all came back better equipped to handle the short-term adjustments of reopening and the longer-term challenge of busines growth.

**Bottom line**: The prize catch is a workforce that’s more skilled, more flexible, less stressed, and ultimately more productive. Developing human capital has the highest strategic ROI of any investment you can make.
