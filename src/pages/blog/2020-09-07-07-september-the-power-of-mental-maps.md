Two weeks ago I said we’d be discussing the importance of having the right mental map if you want to navigate the turbulent VUCA world we find ourselves in. We’ve considered two common mental maps, one good (fish or cut bait, a bias for action) and one that can be problematic (diversification is a good strategy). Before discussing more mental maps and mental traps, I thought it would be worthwhile to review what a mental map really is, and how maps can become traps, if we aren’t careful. A very famous story helps illustrate the power of mental maps. The complete story is told by Thomas Chermack in his book Scenario Planning in Organizations (Berrett-Koehler, 2011).

Shortly after the discovery of the New World in 1492, Spanish explorers began charting the western coast of North America. As early as 1533 ships reached the southern tip of the California Peninsula, what we know today as Baja, and cartographers mapped what they saw as an endless waterway up the 800 miles of the Baja. By 1635 other explorers had sailed into the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Puget Sound. The saw an inland waterway into the 100-mile distance. Combining these two observations, the Spanish concluded that California was an island. The famous 1712 Herman Moll map of North America reflects this assumption.

This may seem like a harmless mistake; however, operating on false assumptions had real costs for the next wave of Spanish explorers, missionaries hoping to bring Christianity to the indigenous people. They landed in Monterrey Bay well stocked with boats—which they carried across California—so they could cross the inland waterway. The boats, dissembled and carried by mules, slowed progress, and created unneeded hardship and struggle as the missionaries crossed the 12,000-foot high peaks of the Sierra Nevada and the ensuing Great Basin Desert. A faulty map proved to be more than a harmless mistake.

**The Power of Mental Maps**

Peter Senge defined mental maps over a quarter-century ago as “deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action.” We draw mental maps as we experience life. They come from a wonderful feature of our world: cause and effect. Cause and effect leads to regularity and predictability in the world we live in and our daily lives. As we experience events that are linked together, so when B follows A, we naturally draw the conclusion that A caused B. Most of the time we are right.

Think about your daily commute. You’ve got a pretty clear mental model of what causes delays in your commute and you plan appropriately. You even account for variation in traffic, weather, or the need to stop at a store on the way home as you plan when to leave home or leave for home. The cost structure of your business, your relationships with customers, and your interactions with suppliers are all based on the principle of cause and effect. The outcome of a mental map, whether it’s around commuting or customer service, is a script—a plan of action. The entire premise behind big data is rooted in the idea that firms that really understand deep causes and their effects will have better scripts and will win in the marketplace.

**Bottom Line:** Taking time to develop and draw correct mental maps can be a source of real competitive advantage for you and your business.

**The Trap of Mental Maps**

Put simply, mental maps are great, except when they’re not. The pandemic has taught us all about having the wrong mental map. Many people latched on to a mental map useful with influenza, that the virus would become less powerful and less pronounced as the weather got warmer. Infections went up over the summer. Economically, many of latched on the mental map that was the “V” shaped recovery. If you took an economy that was humming along and threw it into a policy-induced coma, you could wake it up with little effort and it would be back at full strength. With each passing day, the “V” continues to morph into something else, and the bad dream of 2020 continues.

Where do bad, or faulty, mental maps come from? How can we fail to have a correct map in a world of cause and effect? Well, the world is still cause and effect, but faulty mental maps arise from two sources. First, when we can’t see the link between cause and effect, we draw the wrong conclusions. We may know that A causes B, but it takes a long time to understand what A really is and so we have a hard time connecting true cause and effect. Second, A may cause several versions of B, some of which are known and others unknown. In this case, we don’t understand all the effects.

COVID-19 has both characteristics. It’s hard to identify true causes and each day we learn more about effects. We want cause and effect to be simple, and in this case that’s just not the way things are working. The more we want the virus to conform to our notions of cause and effect, the more it seems to resist easy categorization.

**Bottom Line:** Acting on faulty mental maps never produces good outcomes. Abandon faulty mental maps as soon as possible, even uncertainty is better than false certainty.

Over the next three weeks, we’ll discuss three common mental traps that business leaders fall into: the failure to distinguish between a kind and wicked world, the challenge of siloed, separatist thinking, and the preference for hard knowledge in a soft knowledge world. Your ability to build correct mental maps in these three areas will help your business thrive and grow in the face of continued uncertainty.
