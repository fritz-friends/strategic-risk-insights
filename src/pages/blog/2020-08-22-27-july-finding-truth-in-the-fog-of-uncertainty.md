I spoke with an academic colleague yesterday who began our conversation with “did you hear the good news about the vaccine?” I hadn’t heard. He explained that a Wall Street Journal headline indicated that the US had contracted with Pfizer and BioNtech to secure 100 million doses of the vaccine they are developing. The upside of the article that my friend fixated on? A vaccine could be available by late fall or early next year. The end of the Coronacrisis might be in sight. I read the article and come to a vastly different conclusion than the one my colleague reached.

An old adage teaches that “truth is the first casualty of war.” As the pandemic continues to plague the United States, truth seems to be one of the first and most enduring casualties. The problem in this instance isn’t with the Wall Street Journal, it’s with the readiness of my colleague to believe what a message we’d all like to believe: A vaccine is in sight. I went through my day thinking about how really smart people can have a very difficult time figuring out what is true these days. My colleague had committed some fundamental errors in his rush to relief. Let’s review three simple and easy questions that help discern what’s true versus what’s claimed.

**What does the full information actually say?**

Headlines are written to catch our attention and to draw us in. They are sizzle, but the article, or the information itself, is the steak. The truth about the vaccine became clear as I read the article, what we might think of as the “fine print” of truth. The deal with Pfizer is the 3rd deal the government has signed with various pharma companies to purchase a vaccine. So far, we’ve committed to buy almost $5 billion worth of vaccine. We’ll buy a vaccine, should one be approved by the FDA. The Pfizer version is in the midst of that process, just about to enter “Phase III” clinical trials, which involves testing on a large sample of 30,000 people for efficacy and safety.

The headline wasn’t false, nor was it true. The power of the headline, and all soundbites, is that they resonate with us because we want them, at a cognitive and emotional level, to be true. This is not the classic cognitive bias of the confirmation trap where we only look for evidence that supports our belief. The power of headlines might best be described as the “hopefulness bias,” where we accept an interpretation because it’s what we want to be—not believe to be—true.

**Bottom Line**: Get past the sizzle and focus on the steak. Ask “what is really going on here?” and consider the information objectively, not through the lens of your hopes and desires.

**What’s the context?**

Phase III clinical trials typically take a year or much longer, and the first problem is usually getting enough patients to participate. Patients should not be a big issue in this case, and so the idea of “warp speed” (to us the Government’s own code name for the program) clinical trial is not out of reach. The real challenge is the complete uncertainty about whether or not the vaccine actually proves effective, and how many tests it takes to show that. The FDA has set a standard that the vaccine must be at least 50% effective, preventing the virus in half the people tested, before it will grant a license to any compound.

As a comparison, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is anywhere from 30%-70%, depending on the yearly variations in the influenza virus. So, the COVID-19 virus has to be better than the worst flu vaccine, but not nearly as good as the best one. The context also helps us calibrate truth. A vaccine that’s 50% effective may not be enough to create herd immunity, which would mean that some of the public health issues will remain with us even in the presence of a vaccine. The context helps us judge how well the new information fits with what we already know.

**Bottom Line:** How does the information you are getting relate to other truths that we know about? Does the context support or cast doubt on the new information?

**Is the new information an outlier?**

Outliers are extreme cases; they lie outside the preponderance of data. The Pfizer vaccine and its testing process are outliers in two ways that caution us against jumping to conclusions about the reality of immunizing the nation against COVID-19. At the molecular level, the vaccine hopes to use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as the mechanism to provide immunity. The technology has had some success in treating heart disease and a basket of genetic disorders, but its ability to fight a rapidly multiplying virus is unproven and to date has been unsuccessful. Maybe this time is different. Maybe not.

At the macro-level, the Pfizer timeline would be an outlier for bureaucratic approval. To have a vaccine ready by late fall would mean 1) a successful test completed in the month of August that shaves 11 months off fastest times for Phase III testing, 2) approval by the FDA—through several levels of peer and administrative review—in the 30 days of September, 3) near flawless production, at very large scale and speed, of the first 100 million doses of a brand new vaccine, and 4) effective, rapid distribution and actual immunization of that first group of 100 million. It’s possible, less plausible, but not too probable that the stars would all align at each stage of production to produce a best-case outcome.

**Bottom Line:** Beware the best case, or rosy, scenario. Life rarely works out exactly as planned, and people who plan on the best case happening are often disappointed. The truth is more likely to lie near the average case scenario and so we need to temper our enthusiasm.

Truth is the first casualty of war, and we are at war with COVID-19. These three questions can help you sort through the fog of uncertainty and discern what is true. Making decisions for your
