This week let’s learn about thriving from the ride-hailing giant Uber and its overall business model and performance. Uber’s core business, ride-hailing, was under assault before the pandemic began, as the State of California enacted legislation that would force Uber, rival Lyft, and many other “gig economy” companies to treat their independent contractors as employees. Coronavirus decimated a number of industries, ride hailing among them. At Uber, gross bookings in its core business fell 73%. At rival Lyft, sales were off 61% from a year earlier.

A share of Lyft stock bought on January 2nd cost $43.58. Sold today, that share would generate a net loss of almost $14. A similar investment in Uber, at a cost of $30.99 would generate a $1.31 profit today. Both Uber and Lyft underperformed the S&P 500, but why did Uber generate a positive return when it’s in the same business as Lyft? Uber has diversity, but Lyft does not.

Uber is diversified and Uber Eats turns out to be counter-cyclical to ride-hailing, at least during COVID-19. Since the lockdown, people have limited travel, and that caused the floor to give way at both Uber and Lyft; however, because they couldn’t go out, many had food delivered. Uber Eats saw its revenue grow by 113% in Q2. So, the lesson seems to be a familiar one from finance—a diversified portfolio beats a narrowly held one. That seems to be true, but upon closer reflection we can see that Uber’s diversified portfolio looks great on the top line, but they still have problems to solve for true profitability.

**The power of economies of scope**

When people are asked to name a diversified company, General Electric comes to mind. The company operates in businesses as diverse as aircraft engines, oil and gas transmission, to train locomotives. That type of diversification is conglomeration and, as we can see by GE’s current performance, doesn’t add value to shareholders because the businesses don’t add much value to each other. Uber Eats represents a form of diversification that academics refer to as “related-linked.” Moving people and moving food are definitely related. Uber can employ lessons learned in building its rides business in its food delivery operation. That’s the related part.

The real value, however, comes because the businesses are linked by an economy of scope, where the cost of doing two activities together is less than the cost of doing each separately. Uber Eats and Uber employ the same driver pool, which leverages hiring and onboarding costs. The two businesses also use the same app and back-end technology, which amortizes all those fixed costs over more revenue opportunities. Most of Uber’s stock price gain during the pandemic as a long-term bet by investors that the economy of scope will make Uber more valuable.

**Bottom Line:** When you diversify, look for ways to leverage assets from one business into another. You’ll create an economy of scope that can potentially create lasting value for your business.

**The top line isn’t the bottom line**

Uber Eats did a great job of holding up Uber’s top line, in terms of both gross bookings and what the company calls delivery adjusted revenue. Food delivery gross bookings totaled $6.96 billion, almost $4 billion more than the Rides’ business $3.05 billion. After adjusting for delivery costs, however, the Eats business only garnered $92 million more than Rides. That translates into a negative EBITDA for Eats (-$232 million) and a positive one for Rides, $50 million. The underlying reason? Uber has to give a greater share of gross bookings for Eats deliveries than in the ride-hailing busines.

This makes sense for two underlying reasons. First, food delivery is subject to greater peaks and valleys (lots of diners at 5 pm, not so many at 2 pm) than people delivery. A delivery driver can only deliver so much food during those peaks, and they have to make more to compensate for the volatility in demand. Second, food delivery is primarily short haul, think blocks versus miles. Consequently, drivers demand more for delivering humus than humans. If Uber Eats hopes to generate, rather than eat, cash, Uber has to pass those increased costs onto either restaurants or consumers, the two drivers of its profits.

**Bottom Line**: Beware top line splash that belies dangerous undercurrents in generating real profits.

**Economic fundamentals are, well, fundamental**

Why can’t Uber just raise prices to consumers or take a larger cut from restaurants? Let’s look at restaurants first. Although they earn great gross margins (somewhere around 70%), net margins are pretty small (well under 10%, closer to 5%) because the fixed costs of operating a restaurant are huge. The need to cover fixed costs puts a natural limit on how much of a cut a restaurant can give Uber and still make money themselves. Domino’s Pizza overcomes this problem by not having dine in options, which dramatically reduces their fixed costs, but your average Olive Garden doesn’t have that option. Uber Eats delivers for Olive Garden, but not Dominos.

On the customer side, there’s a natural governor on willingness to pay for delivery as well: the take-out option. I might be willing to pay, for example, a $5 delivery charge for lukewarm food, but at $7.50 I’d rather pick it up myself. The presence of a strong substitute (take-out) creates a limit to what Uber Eats can charge. As the price of delivery goes up to cover driver fees, the number of customers willing to pay goes down. Unless Uber can overcome the power of a close substitute, the long-term outlook of the Eats business doesn’t look great.

**Bottom Line**: Understand the core economic fundamentals that drive your stakeholders. Their costs of doing business and overall willingness to pay will determine your own profitability.

Uber offers a powerful set of lessons for businesses trying to grow through diversification: focus on economies of scope and be well aware of the fundamental economics that drive your suppliers and customers.
