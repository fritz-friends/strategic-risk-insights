Last week’s post took up the preliminary question of any strategy review, what’s going on here? I can’t overemphasize the importance of this question because if you assess the problem poorly and ask the wrong question, then the answers are meaningless. Remember this helpful rule from the airline industry: the 1 in 60 rule. If you fly from Osaka to Los Angeles, which I’ve done, and the pilot is off a mere one degree at the beginning, your plane will land in Santa Barbara. Not fatal, but a costly mistake.

In the current environment, landing in Santa Barbara instead of Los Angeles may be the difference between positive and negative cash flow, so it’s critical to be clear and precise about where you are. It’s equally vital to be clear about where you want to end up. Your destination will be driven by two things, your mission statement, and your value proposition.

Assuming you get the preliminary work right, then the first question of strategic renewal is “where should we go?” The answer often has multiple elements, such as strong brand, loyal customers, a tightly integrated (or loosely coupled) supply chain, and dedicated employees. Any strategic change you initiate will require the right balance between multiple objectives and your mission and value proposition will help you determine how to make those tradeoffs. You must also account for organizational inertia. COVID-19 has increased inertia across the board, it’s like swimming in molasses. To help evaluate these dual challenges, I find the following variation on the risk management heat map to be particularly helpful.

Formulating, revising, and implementing strategy is a long journey, and the map to your right provides two critical decision markers: what’s the potential impact of the change you want to make (the value question) and how hard will shifting our strategy be (the inertia question)? You can rate each potential change you consider and put them on the matrix. In general, you’ll find that changes fall into one of four quadrants and we’ll look at each one.

**Full Speed Ahead**

Some changes will have high impact and can be accomplished with relatively little organizational pain. Many leaders have been surprised at how easily, and how hastily, they’ve redesigned the office: it’s empty now and everyone’s on Zoom. The impact for many employees, and work groups, has been very positive. Work where output (lines of code written, research papers submitted) matters more than input (manufacturing time on the line) have benefited most. Professional productivity has increased, and many employees feel greater loyalty toward employers that trust them. The impact has also been quite low. Most knowledge workers already had laptops and great web access and carving out a home office hasn’t been too much of a hassle. Strategic changes like these are great: High Payoff with little effort.

**Caught in a cul-de-sac**

Some changes look attractive because they are low effort, but they produce little payoff. One automotive group that we worked with wanted to improve their share in a foreign market for their vehicles and add-on services. The market was tiny, and the firm had little appetite to make substantial changes. Ease of implementation trumped potential impact and the firm found itself with very few options, none of which would close the market-share gap as they hoped. The engagement ended with the client spinning in circles, trapped in the cul-de-sac of ease but unable to create new value.

**Thrilling Vista?**

Many leaders opt for strategic changes with high potential payoffs, but that will require significant effort to overcome organizational inertia. Strategic product development often falls into this category. Another firm we’re working with is an old-line brick and mortar bank. They’ve got a strong balance sheet and well-diversified loan portfolio. Their actions during the Paycheck Protection Program (they set up an online shop to process a significant loan volume) opened their eyes to the potential of online banking to expand their geographic footprint and customer base. Their challenge? They still think like an old bank. They struggle to grasp the reality that online marketing knows no regional boundary. The new business has great economic fundamentals and would be a thrilling vista IF the organization can make the hard structural and perceptual changes needed.

**Danger Ahead**

Very few businesspeople willingly enter the danger zone. The market has a great way of weeding them out and redistributing their capital. Most who enter the danger zone do so unawares—what they thought was a minor change (think full speed ahead) turned out to have a major impact on the organization while creating very little long-term value. A recent client, a professional services firm, struggled with an outsourcing decision, and some initial analysis suggested that outsourcing could save the company money, improve efficiency, and might even improve quality. When viewed from a strategic perspective, however, a major risk emerged: the process was core to the organization’s value proposition. If they outsourced, they’d abandon critical knowledge, and the cost savings and efficiency improvements vanished. The leadership team realized they’d have to take on extra work and hire a “minder” to oversee the outsource partner. They avoided the danger.

The strategic roadmap isn’t my invention, the basic notion has been used by smart consultants top help executive teams see the full implications of their choice of “where to go.” As you continue to assess the COVID-19 landscape, you’ll arrive at the point where you’ll answer the “where do we go?” The map can help you see many less than apparent tradeoffs you’ll need to make as you choose a direction of travel.
