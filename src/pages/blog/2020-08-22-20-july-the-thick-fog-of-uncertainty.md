Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, gave a webinar this week to a group of business economists. She doesn’t usually go on the speaking circuit and so when she says something, people listen. I loved her analysis of the economic situation because she cut through all the soft-tones and comments tinged by illusory hopes. She said “A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us . . . The recovery is likely to face headwinds even if the downside risks do not materialize, and a second wave would magnify that challenge.” Thick fog is a great metaphor, one I can relate to. I’ve walked and driven through thick fog, and it’s unsettling at best.

How do you navigate in the fog? Fog lights. Why do fog lights work? They are designed to overcome the challenges of fog. Fog is really just a cloud close to earth with two unique properties: 1) it rarely touches the ground, and 2) . it reflects light that hits it. Fog lights work because 1) they are lower to the ground, and 2) they have a sharp cutoff angle that limits the light to that which shines on the ground, and not up into the reflective fog. So, fog lights work because they keep the light, and your focus, grounded. To be grounded in business is to be grounded in truth. Let’s talk about two fundamental truths.

**Ground yourself in stakeholder realities**

70% of the US economy depends on consumer spending. Remember this truth. If you are a B2C company, you know that your customers won’t shop until they feel safe; safe in your store, or confident that they should spend the money. If you are B2B, you are one or more steps removed from end users, but think about ways you can help your customers make their customers feel safe and ready to spend.

I’ve spoken to this before, but your employees are your greatest asset. Everyone says it, but few realize how true that is. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 40% of American families have children under 18. That means, as a rough and ready rule, that 2 out of every five of your workers, and 4 out of 5 of your female workers, will be juggling home-schooling and work in about six weeks. How you work with them will, in large measure, determine the profitable growth trajectory of your business for the next couple of years. You’ll get more productivity from them in the short run and the long run when you support them as they balance the demands of work and home. You’ll often get more by requiring less.

Being grounded in the real lives of your stakeholders also helps you know when to turn the fog lights off and think longer term. As customers open their wallets, and as employees experience less stress and more control over the work-life balance issue, you’ll be able to lift your gaze and look further down the road.

**Bottom Line:** The lived reality of your customers, employees, and other key stakeholders is your best guide to cutting through the fog of uncertainty. They’ll help you recognize and navigate the upcoming bumps in the road.

**Ground yourself in principles**

There are a set of basic business principles that provide grounding guidance in today’s uncertain markets. Four of these key principles are worth noting. First, a strong balance sheet provides more flexibility than a weak one. Improve your current ratio—a key driver of your cash burn rate—because it offers the best hope to sustain your business over the next year. Refinance existing debt but stay away from new debt other than lines of credit. Second, in a crisis, prudence beats exuberance every time. Smart companies are pruning their least profitable product extensions so they better support core lines. Third, penetration-oriented growth (selling more to existing customers) outperforms product- (new products to existing customers) or market- (new markets for existing products) centered growth. Sell more to your love group. Finally, balance short term cost cutting with long-term strategic advantage. For example, if everyone is cutting their ad spending, then increasing yours may earn disproportionate reward.

Freidrich Nietzsche spoke truth when he noted “He \[or she] who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” Paychecks and profits help us live, but they can’t create a life filled with meaning. When we have meaning and purpose in what we are doing, we find greater clarity in our work. That’s true for individuals and organizations. If your why is grounded in helping people and excellent customer service, for example, what better time to focus on helping than when so many people are in distress. If it’s product or process quality, the Coronavirus pandemic has provided a wonderful experiment in maintaining and improving quality in harsh circumstances. Innovators have plenty of opportunities to identify new demands for value and create products/ services to satisfy those demands. Those focused on social benefit have no shortage of opportunities to fulfill that mission.

In terms of knowing when to “look up” for a clearing in the thick fog, principles help here as well. Principles are always long term and strategic. Programs, on the other hand, focus on the short term and are tactical in nature. Programs worked for Coronavirus 1 (March through June); the winners in Coronavirus 2 (July through December) will double down on their values and get back to business basics.

**Bottom line**: Principles ground you in what matters most, and they resist the glare and confusion that comes from gazing into fog, thick or thin. Principles will guide you today and help you spot the destination markets and societies will move toward.

We are driving through thick fog today. Many of us though that by now the Coronavirus would be in the rearview mirror. Not so, it continues to be all around us. As you navigate through this thick fob, remember to use your fog lights and stay grounded.
