This week is the final installment of my posts on making strategic adjustments heading into next year and beyond. I’ve discussed the challenges of solving a mystery versus building a puzzle, how to figure out “what’s going on here,” and to decide “where should we go.” This week I’m going to offer some very practical advice that I’ve seen effective leaders use to create real change. Be aware that this week’s post isn’t rocket science, but the lessons here will dramatically improve the odds that your strategic change sticks. Some of these lessons are small, but essential aspects of strong leadership.

Before diving into the solution, let’s name the problem we’re facing. It’s not bureaucratic inertia, or even people’s fundamental aversion to change. In their great book *The 4 Disciplines of Execution,* authors Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, and Jim Huling nail the problem: The Whirlwind. The whirlwind is the day to day activities that fill our lives and our days at work. We’ve all got so much going on right now, that taking on something new just isn’t an option. Your first and foremost enemy to change is all the good things (and some bad things) your people are already doing. Here some tips of overcoming the whirlwind.

**Stay focused on the prize**

My first job out of college was as a Restaurant Manager for Taco Bell. Running a quick service restaurant is the definition of a whirlwind. Just running the operation day to day takes a lot, and there are always whirlwinds with customers, employees, and suppliers. At the same time, you’re trying to improve the quality of your product, and grow your share of stomach in your respective market. My boss gave me some great advice: “when you’re up to your waist in alligators, it’s hard to remember that your original purpose was to drain the swamp.” Wresting alligators is hard work, and I found if I drained the swamp, the alligators moved away.

You avoid wrestling alligators, first and foremost, by having your overall goal written down where you, and everyone on your team, can see it every day. I’m old school, so it’s not on a website, Facebook page, Slack, or Twitter. It’s printed out and placed where everyone can see it. As Notre Dame football players leave the locker room and head to the field, they pass under a sign saying, “play like a champion today.” It’s not about yards, passes, blocks, or tackles; those are the alligators. Playing like a champion is the overall goal.

**Bottom Line**: Make sure everyone on your team knows what success means, and make sure they can see that every day. We do what we remember, so make sure you remember.

**Control your time**

Another wise boss I worked for taught me the second principle of getting stuff done: Control your time. He lived by a great mantra: “I will only do that which I only can do.” One of the features of the whirlwind is that it creates an “all-hands-on-deck” mentality; COVID has proven that true. For much of the last six months, everyone has been focused on dealing with disrupted supply chains, disoriented employees, and discouraged customers. Because the buck stops at the executive desk, many leaders I know jumped in to help. That was great then, but now it’s time to step back and realize that only you, as a leader, can shape and sustain strategic change.

Jeff Weiner, CEO and founder of LinkedIn has a great solution to controlling his time: He leaves large blocks of time, 60-90 minutes each day, unscheduled. And he’s religious about not letting the whirlwind blow things into that time. What Weiner learned is that strategic change and leadership requires time to sit back, evaluate what’s happening in the organization, and thoughtfully and thoroughly plot a course of action. When it comes to getting things done, leaders need large blocks of time to coach and mentor others in the organization. There’s no shortcut to dedicating this time to help your reports succeed. When your people solve their own whirlwinds, it allows you to be more effective.

**Bottom Line:** You are, or should be, in control of your time. If you don’t have control, get it. Only you can lead strategic change, and make sure you dedicate enough time to your unique role.

**Create Small Wins**

Start small and grow from there. Your organization has seen enough failed changes that the default for any new initiative is “just wait, it will fail as well.” Anticipating failure, people withhold their effort and expertise from making the change work. The lack of commitment leads to a lack of results, which spirals downward until the change effort dies a silent death. One way to short circuit this natural entropy is to provide early evidence that the change will produce positive results. Seek small wins.

A small win has to be relevant to the change—it has to move a dial that really matters, but it only has to prove directionality. If your ultimate goal is to increase inventory turns by 50%, then begin with a small product line that you know can move more rapidly. Engage a small team to clear bottlenecks and show that success is possible within a couple of months. When that happens and you move on to a larger product line, you’ll have a core set of believers, and they’ll help others become engaged.

**Bottom Line:** the commitment/results dynamic works both ways. When a few committed people produce results, they allow others to take a risk and commit. Larger groups produce larger change over time, but it all starts with that first, small, and quick win.

2020 has been brutal, and 2021 looks like another tough year. As you engage in strategic planning and budgeting for next year, remember that your solving a mystery, not a puzzle. Assess what’s really going on, decide where to go next, and then use these three simple steps to help you get there. All of your key stakeholders, from communities to investors, will benefit and see their own businesses grow.
