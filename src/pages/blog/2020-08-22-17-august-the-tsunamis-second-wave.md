I learned an interesting, useful, and tragic fact about Tsunami’s some years ago. These massive shock waves of water cause tremendous amounts of damage as they hit the shoreline. Just six inches of the rushing water of a Tsunami can knock a person off their feet and the force can sweep away cars and other objects. An inbound Tsunami causes tremendous damage, but so does an outbound one.

I’m not sure where we are in the Tsunami that has been COVID-19, but there is some data emerging about the longer- term impacts on business as we continue to move through the summer. The initial shock of the lockdowns can be likened to powerful waves making landfall that wreaked havoc on every sector of the economy and society. That water has stuck around a lot longer than any of us anticipated, and now we are beginning to see some lasting ramifications for different economic sectors as it heads back out to sea. Let me focus on two: travel and education.

**Travel: The carnage in business travel**

When the economy went into its medically induced coma in March, travel ground to a halt. In fact, I was staying in a condo in Moab, Utah when the stay-at-home orders were first issued. We left and have not been back. We are not alone. Leisure and business travelers all remained at home, planes flew empty routes to keep their landing rights, and hotels scrambled. There has been some recovery in leisure travel, but business travel continues to flag. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that travel itineraries from corporate customers were down 97% from a year earlier. 97%! That means that for every 100 business travelers last July, there are 3 now. Lost spending may total well beyond $2 trillion dollars in 2020 alone.

That’s a staggering sum, but there’s a more dire economic reality behind it: although business travelers represent only 15% of airline passengers, they represent 40% of carrier revenues, and maybe even greater profit. The reality is that much of that $2 trillion will be gone for good, lost to technological shifts due to Zoom meetings, Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx, and other platforms. I’ll still travel, as we all will, but I’ll be very careful to make sure that the marginal benefit of an in-person meeting outweighs the costs (and risks) of getting on a plane.

Think for a moment, about how the devastation from this receding wave and its attendant long-term change. Airlines face the unsavory prospect of laying off well over 100,000 people industry wide. They’ve dropped orders for new jets like hot potatoes. That brings a substantial portion of the almost $1 trillion aerospace industry to a halt. That includes Boeing for sure, but also the thousands of Tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers who contribute to the industry. That’s just on the supply side. The loss of business travel expands forward into hotels, restaurants, rental cars, and ride services. Think about the devastation in automobile production as a major source of vehicle purchases dries up.

**Bottom Line:** The breadth and depth of the economic shock is only now coming into full view. How does your business look?

**Education: Painful change and disruption**

When the lockdowns hit, none of us had any idea how it would affect schools and kids. Colleges went online, and that was a relatively easy transition because students are adults. They could hole up in their apartments without parental supervision, and most of them had ready access to technology. High school, Jr. High kids, and elementary schoolers fared far worse. They had to have mom and/or dad around to keep an eye on them, and many parents found themselves juggling work and teaching various grade levels all at the same time. Far too many kids had unreliable, or no, access to the internet, laptops, and the other tools needed to succeed. Everyone limped by, hoping that fall would bring a return to normal.

To look at things this week, you’d think that school administrators did nothing to prepare; they seem as lost as they were in the spring. This is a vague, wrong assumption. What makes the challenges of educational change so difficult is the tremendous inertia that we all appreciate in the educational system. Parents, and by extension employers, have arranged their work lives—daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly—to fit a particular school cadence. Every parent has complained at some point about some aspect of the school system, but if they think about the disruption to their own lives that changes would cause, most quickly back off and accept the status quo.

Education is complex, with a number of different stakeholders, each with different time horizons. The fiasco that is college football, or full time in-person K-12 instruction, are emblematic of the tension between short term economic gains/ losses and long-term goals like safety and sustainability. Everyone’s livelihood stands to be impacted by school decisions. What makes all this so complicated, however, is that education is the most future-focused sector in our economy. It’s not just about college football this fall, it’s about graduation rates and children being left behind over the next decade.

In education, the power of inertia is hard to deny. For many other businesses, it’s much harder to see how our lives have been structured around critical processes. Banking, cash management, tax bills, and a host of financial elements of most businesses exist in this taken for granted space, and as we think about changes to these sectors, we may all prefer the stability of what we know.

**Bottom Line**: What changes to your business ecosystem do you see? Where will the inertia of established systems hurt you the most?

The receding Tsunami of Coronavirus exposes how interconnected our economy and society really is. As the flood waters fade away, the damage between sectors becomes more apparent. As you navigate the next few weeks, look for how big your own ecosystem is, and begin to think about how disruption and distress in one part of that system might affect you. That broader vision will help you make better decisions about how you want to respond.
