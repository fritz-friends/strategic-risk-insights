McDonald’s Corporation announced their first quarter earnings and we got a glimpse of the decline is business in the DC (during Coronavirus) world. Same store sales slid by 3.4%, driving total revenue down by 6%. Profit fell 17%. More telling, however, are the monthly sales totals. Sales for January and February were up 8%, then fell off 13.5% in March. Sales from mid-March to mid-April fell 25%. That gives us some idea that we are still deep into a DC world. McDonald’s business has weathered the storm well.

As of the end of the week, the company’s shares were down just over 11%, compared to almost 30% for competitor Shake Shack. Why has McDonalds done relatively well? In this post, we’ll consider three reasons. First, McDonald’s had limited its exposure to the Chinese market a couple years ago when it sold the majority of its stake in the country to the state-owned Chinese company CITIC. Second, McDonald’s business model has morphed over the years into a primarily drive-thru business that generated 70% of sales before the crisis. When the company closed its doors to dine-in traffic, it only put at risk less than 1/3 of its business.

Third, McDonalds restructured its menu to fit the crisis. The major change? The company eliminated its all-day breakfast offering. The McMuffin is now only available before 10:30. Some analysts puzzled at this move. Why cut a popular product line and the associated revenue? After all, with revenue already shrinking, and profits at risk, why cut a very profitable part of the menu? McDonald’s did so for both tactical and strategic reasons.

**Tactical simplicity**

The Egg McMuffin and its companions on the breakfast menu are highly profitable. They require less meat and cheese than Big Macs and McNuggets, and they are simpler to assemble. It’s a double win—lower food and labor costs, which translate into higher gross margins. That’s if the menu items are sold at breakfast, but when they are sold all day the labor savings vanish because staff needs to make burgers and fries as well. Total costs go up because all-day breakfast makes the entire operation, from inventory to food item assembly, more complex. Putting breakfast back where it belongs simplified operations, which means they can serve more customers faster. This really matters when there’s only one point of service: The drive-thru window.

The key lesson? Simplify your operations and play to your strengths. McDonald’s had to make minor tweaks to its menu, and it’s physical assets were ready for the shift to a DC world. The menu changes, plus a few other operating changes like having customers wait a couple minutes in the parking lot while their order is brought to them, eliminated the key bottle neck of a single point of sale. Which part of your business is most amenable to continuing through DC restrictions? How can you simplify and adjust your operations to thrive over the next six weeks?

**Strategic Alignment**

When McDonald’s rolled out all-day breakfast, the company got a huge boost in short-term revenue, and breakfast menu items now bring in 1 of every 4 revenue dollars. That’s great, but over the long-term the move created problems for McDonald’s: sales in what the company refers to as the “breakfast daypart” have declined. Consumers still by their McMuffins, they now do it in the afternoon and evening, not the morning. McDonald’s has actually lost business to other competitors, like Wendy’s, who now offer their own breakfast menu. Declining sales in the morning mean higher costs through product complexity that overshadow lower costs of good sold. McDonalds set up a situation where it traded revenue growth for profit. The problem became how to change this situation without losing both profit and revenue. Enter the Coronacrisis, as we all know it’s a shame to let a good crisis go to waste.

Removing all-day breakfast simplifies operations, but it also gives the Golden Arches a chance to retrain its customers. During DC, if I want my Sausage McMuffin, I’ve got to go before 10:30. My guess is that in an AC world, McDonald’s will prefer to view all-day breakfast as a casualty of COVID-19. They have created a new, short-term expectation, that breakfast is a morning meal. The challenge for them will be to not let customers, or franchisees, slip back into old habits. If they do, they’ll once again enjoy higher margins in the morning and better asset utilization as sales will spread out over the whole day. Revenue and profit will cease to work in opposite directions.

The lesson for your business? Now is the time to make some “strategic readjustments” in the mindset of your customers and your product offerings. Where are you trading revenue for profit? Go back through your profit and loss data, on a product by product, customer by customer basis, and discover the many ways you’ve allowed “meeting customer demand” to shrink the bottom line. You’ll find an Egg McMuffin or two in your product mix, and you’ll find that some customer accounts absorb all the profit through things like customization, delivery, service, or other arrangements.

As you prepare for an AC (After Corona) world, how can you realign your business to earn more profitable revenue? How can you help your customers—who are used to disruptions and changes by now—migrate towards your highest margin, high-growth offerings? How can you blend tactical efficiency with strategic effectiveness as you continue to respond to life in a DC world? You’ll be far better off in our impending AC one. I’d love to hear from you about what you and your business are doing.
