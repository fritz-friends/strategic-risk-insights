With the rise of big data and data analytics over the last decade or so, most CEOs have firmly bought into the paradigm of data-driven decision making. Advances in collecting and sifting through data have powerfully improved their abilities to cut costs and identify potential sources of value in meeting customer needs. We’ve had a great ride, but COVID-19 has brought the data train to a screeching halt. The problem most senior executives face right now is trying to divine the way forward in the absence of good data. There is far too much bad and misleading data.

The lack of data should come as no surprise because the Coronavirus is an uncertainty, not a risk, event. The hallmark of risk is the ability to use data to calculate probabilities of potential outcomes and their magnitude. The defining aspect of uncertainty is precisely the lack of data on which to make such predictions. We have no data on the bridge because we’re building it as we move across it. We have a sample of one right now, and that sample gets revised every day. Before I suggest a way forward (getting small quantities of high value data), let me highlight two data problems we have.

**COVID-19 reporting: The case of bad data**

Confirmed Case Counts. We all wait anxiously every day for governors or public health officials to give us the daily update for confirmed cases. The problem with this data? It woefully underestimates the number of actual cases and its wildly out of data. The case count tells us how many people have tested positive for the virus, which is a function of how many people have been tested. Who gets tested? Those with severe symptoms that meet certain criteria (fever, dry cough, etc.). We learned last week for a Stanford University study that up to 40% of people are asymptomatic, and only 20% of people require hospitalization. Multiply the daily total by somewhere between two and four for a good estimate.

The case count doesn’t tell us how many people became infected today, but rather how many people were infected somewhere around two to three weeks ago. The incubation time for the virus is between five and fourteen days, and it takes about a week to get the tests back. So, if I am confirmed today as COVID-19 positive, I can subtract a week for testing and at about one more for the day I actually contracted the virus. The case count tells us what was happening two weeks ago, not today.

Death Statistics and Death Rates. We’ve got two problems here: some communities are underestimating the number of coronavirus deaths, and others are overcounting them. If a community only counts a COVID-19 death as arising from a confirmed case, they will undercount people who aren’t confirmed but die from heart failure, pneumonia, or some coronavirus-driven cause. Other communities overreact. Belgium, for example, counts every death in a nursing home as a coronavirus fatality. This overcounts the death rate by, as one official estimated, a factor of two.

**Better decision making: Finding valuable data in small quantities**

Look for currents, not waves. My friend and colleague Christoff Beck, COO of Ecolab, talks about making decisions based on currents, not waves. Waves are epiphenomenal—they are on the surface for all to see, and they’re here right now. Waves can be very destructive over the short term. Think Tsunami. Currents run deep. They escape detection by the untrained and unaware, and they endure. We have seen, over the last week, record-setting and mind-numbing new claims for unemployment. This spike is a wave, and we should see, over the next several months, most of that wave dissipate as people return to work. My estimate would be between 90-95% of people will return to work. What are the currents at work here? First, we’ve got an economy that went from full throttle to full stop. Every economist would predict a massive shock from that kind of motion. But the potential for full throttle remains.

Second, the federal stimulus package encourages individuals to file for unemployment, and their managers to encourage it. For those making less than $15/ hour, they make more being unemployed than at work. What we see here is individuals and business owners behaving in economically rational ways that maximize their own income. The 5-10% of jobs that won’t return? Those are from unhealthy companies that won’t survive and survived only in a full employment economy. The fundamental economic realities haven’t changed during the crisis, they are the currents spawning the waves.

Look for granular data. Large scale data on the pandemic is like a vaccine, probably a year away. Right now, we’re in the middle and collecting data. Big data isn’t the only way to make good decisions. You can decide based on shallow facts with lots of data points (the river that’s a mile wide and an inch deep), or you can employ deep, rich data with far fewer data points (a river several yards wide and several feet deep). Rich data gives you insight into currents, and disconfirming data, and also understanding of what’s really happening in relevant pockets of your business.

Where do you find this data? From your customers, through your frontline employees. It’s the lending officers, branch managers, underwriters, approvers, and customer service reps who can give you the pulse of your customer base. The challenge for the C-Suite is that they typically don’t get data from this level of the organization; it’s all filtered through several layers of abstraction and management. So, if you want the best data available, talk to your frontline employees, and get high-quality, rich reports of what’s going on in your organization and your market.

These are challenging times. Many people have opinions, and those holding them often believe that with enough volume or sincerity, their opinions will become facts. You can’t turn a maybe into a sure thing, so you need to develop channels that will help you see the currents, find the pockets of disconfirming data, and get the rich, detailed stories your frontline workers can tell. Good luck.
