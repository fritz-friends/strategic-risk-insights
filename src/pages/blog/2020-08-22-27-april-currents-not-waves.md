This week I want to follow up on a comment in last week’s post: The advice to focus on currents, not waves. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote this in 1843: “Give me truths, for I am weary of the surfaces, and die of inanition.” Inanition means lack of nourishment. Emerson knew that surface things don’t nourish, only truths do. What I see as I talk with people today is a sense of exhaustion, of a lack of the nourishment that clarity, not uncertainty, provides. In the language of the metaphor, waves don’t nourish us or our business, currents do. That’s because waves carry energy, currents generate it.

**Properties of Waves**

*Transverse waves* come about when the material being carried by the wave runs perpendicular to the energy stream fueling the wave. Transverse motion creates chop and churn—waves that roil and shift direction. We see media pundits and politicians whipsawing between encouraging herd immunity that spares the economy and waiting for a vaccine that will protect and preserve lives. Chop makes forward motion difficult, uncomfortable, and requires greater navigational skills. Bad information and piecemeal data coming that comes out in dribbles and drabs contributes to choppy waves. This week, a study in New York found that 21% of the people they tested had been (unknowingly) infected and already had antibodies. What does that mean? Hard to judge from one data point. Smart decision makers will consider the implications but wait for confirming evidence before acting.

*Longitudinal waves*, as you might expect, are those where the material being carried moves along the path of the energy flow. These are the waves surfers love: they “ride the wave” into shore, harnessing its energy for productive work/fun. Business leaders can ride these waves when they find opportunities to use the current situation to advance strategic priorities. Deepening your organization’s commitment to your people helps you solve problems related to uncertainty. For employees, that means paying them, continuing benefits, focusing on training and development to calm their anxiety and keep them productive. For clients and customers is checking in on them, personally, and working on a relationship that transcend the latest transaction. 

The **implications** for bank are clear: get off transverse waves and leverage longitudinal ones. A story illustrates my point. Have you ever wondered why the Notre Dame/ Navy rivalry is one of the oldest on the gridiron, even though Notre Dame leads the series 76-13-1? It’s because Navy helped Notre Dame move from a transverse to a longitudinal wave. First hit by the financial pressures of the Great Depression and then seeing its student body leave to fight in World War II, Notre Dame was running out of money and faced closure. The US Navy rescued their rival by setting up a training base on campus, which provided the needed funds to keep the doors open. Notre Dame schedules the Naval Academy every year to repay that kindness, for almost seven decades. Where’s your Notre Dame?

**Properties of Currents**

Waves transmit energy, currents create it. Currents are the deep, long term forces, principles, and trends that generate energy. The current crisis owes to three deep currents, one coming from biology, one from social realities, and one from geography. 

*More toxic bugs*. As medicine has gotten better over the last century, we’ve eliminated or mitigated the impact of the mild to moderate bacteria and viruses. Common bacteria can be killed with Antibiotics and we can now vaccinate against many viruses. What we’re threatened by now tend to be new, uncommon, and highly virulent bugs that hit humans hard because we have no natural or man-made defenses. Why will it take a year or more to find a vaccine? Coronavirus is tough and resists easy fixes.

*Time lags.* Viruses become pandemics because of two critical, and biologically and social hardwired, time lags. First, there is a lag between infection and onset of symptoms; second, the lag between the onset of symptoms in enough people for the medical community to realize that a new pathogen has arrived on the scene. These lags mean that the infection can be transmitted to many, many others before anyone realizes there’s a real problem. Every day counts when dealing with a disease that transfers at a multiplicative rate, but there is a structural window for a disease to spread before it gets on anyone’s radar screen.

*Global integration.* In a more genteel age, we had epidemics, or sickness that impacted a lot of people in a limited area. Now we have pandemics (the prefix pan means “all”), or infections that impact lots of people in lots of places. The current energizing todays Coronavirus wave also fuels globalized manufacturing chains (with their scale economies and geographically leveraged skills), financial institutions that create arbitrage profits around the world, and open up diverse markets for goods and services, from asparagus to zippers. Guarding against future pandemics means altering what has evolved into a very sophisticated and efficient business ecosystem.

The **implication** for leaders is equally clear: spend your time identifying currents, figure out what waves they generate, and get longitudinal to those waves. For example, more toxic bugs mean more innovation, science, and medical devices. How well do you do financing biotech companies or equipment startups? De-coupling from global supply chains has huge implications for business financing, from commercial real estate to working capital loans. Where are you ready? Vulnerable? Smart bankers will be thinking now how to lead their clients through that transition.
