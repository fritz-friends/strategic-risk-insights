This week I decided to update one of my favorite posts from early in the Coronacrisis. I’ve made a few changes based on the current situation, but for the most part the advice is quite robust and solid.

I love to hike. There’s an interesting challenge that all hikers face when we want to ascend some lofty peak: we have to get through the foothills first. The problem is that the foothills obscure the peak; sometimes those foothills can be treacherous enough that we lose our way. That most often happens as we face big boulders, thick underbrush, or ravines during our journey through the foothills. We lose our way when we look for the easiest and most convenient way, but what’s seems easy often makes our ultimate journey harder and longer.

As 2020 moves toward its final days, I still have the feeling that we’re trying to get through the foothills. They looked easy to climb from afar (remember the predictions of the “V” shaped downturn—quick in and quick out?), but now that we’re in the middle of it, we face a series of hurdles, tough choices, and uncertainty that can lead us astray. In what follows, I’ll discuss three powerful tools to help: Having the right goal in the front of your mind, consulting a good map, and using the best compass available.

**The Right Goal**

Elihu Goldratt changed the world of operations management with his book *The Goal*. The protagonist, Alex, must improve productivity at one of his company’s production facilities in order to save the plant. Alex crosses paths with one of his old college professors, Jonah, who spends the book tutoring Alex on how to save the plant. Alex sees problems with inputs, throughputs, and all sorts of efficiency issues around the plant. Jonah helps him prioritize by teaching him the goal of the plant is not to make product, but to make money.

As I’m looking at businesses continuing to navigate 2020’s fundamental challenges, too many businesses are still treading water—they’re focused on revenue, not profit. The world of professional sports is a great example. The NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLB are either competing, or have completed, something of a season. They earned TV revenue, but with 40% of revenue coming from fans in the stands, they’re spending money to lose money. They’re hoping to lose less, but they’re still losing. The leagues, and many restaurants, hotels, and airlines, are all trying to figure out how to generate a profit through the coming winter and on into 2021. 

*Bottom line:* Reopening isn’t just about earning revenue; it’s about making money over both the short and long term. Smart business leaders will turn their focus to profit, not just revenue, and ask a set of hard questions about economic sustainability.

**A Good Map**

If the destination or goal is profit, then the map is strategy. Your strategy *isn’t* to turn a profit, your strategy *is* a set of coordinated actions that help you do just that. Profit is the destination; strategy is the roadmap that gets you there. The basic question of strategy is “how do we create value for our customers or clients?” Businesses create value in one of two ways: saving customers money or providing them with a differentiated product they can’t get anywhere else.

As I’m out and about at different businesses, it seems as if the low-cost/ price strategies are having an easier, but not simple, time. Some of the most dedicated low-cost outlets have done little to change store layouts, remerchandise, or make efforts to encourage social distancing. The real challenge for the cost leaders continues to be getting enough volume at low margins to turn a profit. Companies that rely on customer relationships, product quality, or brand power have taken a much more cautious approach. They’re focused on attracting the right numbers of the right customers. They’re nervous about any action that threatens the core of their customer relationship.

*Bottom line*: Plan for a future that not only preserves your strategy but enhances it. If you compete on cost, find new ways to capture volume from hesitant competitors and consumers. If quality, dependability, brand, or some other difference maker allows you to win with customers, tread lightly and make sure you meet the needs of your most demanding customers. If you can satisfy them, those with less demands will follow.

**The Compass**

Compasses and maps go together; having one but not the other doesn’t work. Direction and location fit hand in glove for a hiker. Your business compass is the set of shared values that holds your coalition of stakeholders together. Values underlie strategy and enliven it. Values allow you to make the long-term investments that drive down costs or create unique differentiation for customers. *Values give strategies time to mature.* 

As you plan for 2021, what are the core values you share with each important stakeholder group? Profitable growth in this tough environment isn’t about letting one set of values trump the others, it’s about finding balance. My favorite burger place, as a family run company, continues to put employee safety at the top of the list. They’ve found a way to keep their employees safe while still meeting customer needs for great food, delivered hot and fresh. They’ve opened their dining room to help make money, but they’ve done so in a way that customers and employees will all feel safe. 

*Bottom line:* Your core, shared values with each stakeholder group provide a set of guardrails for you as you climb the hills just ahead. They don’t necessarily tell you which part of the trail to take, but they will help you see where *not* to go. That’s worth a lot, because in today’s environment, not getting it wrong may matter more than getting it right.

Climbing the foothills is always a challenge, and I’ve gotten off track many a time. As you focus on profitably in 2021, in a way that leverages your core strategic advantages, and preserves your commitment to core values, you’ll navigate the foothills pretty well. Remember, though, that once you’re out of the foothills, the big mountain is yet to come. More challenges, yes, but more beauty and greater payoff as well.
