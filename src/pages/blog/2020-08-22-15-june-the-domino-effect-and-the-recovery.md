I sat on a panel this week with an economist who shared more sobering data about the economic collapse that we’re working our way through. He noted that we’re all taking hope in some pretty bleak numbers—we rejoice in news that’s “not so bad.” Unemployment sits at 13.3% but may really be as high as 16+%, but hey, at least it’s not 20%. Jobless claims for this week came in at 1.5 million, heading in the right direction but still 7 times higher than the 2019 weekly average. In spite of all the numbers, he still predicts a “V” recovery, with GDP returning to previous levels sometime in the fall.

What I’m seeing now is the “Domino effect” as the full implications of the economic shock (some referred to it as a medically induced coma) created by pandemic lockdowns continue to work their way through the US economy. As more reports come in from May’s economic activity, and as I talk with more people, two pieces of data stand out to me this week.

**LA Shipping Volume is Down 30%**

Volume at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s busiest port, was down 30% in May. The cause was a wicked blend of 1) Coronavirus impacts that have delayed orders and production, 2) rules that prohibit crews from coming ashore and leaving many containers stranded at sea, and 3) the continuing negative impact on global shipping arising from the US trade dispute with China. The website Marine Link quotes the Executive Director of the LA Port, Gene Seroka, as saying, “ we believe the effects of these \[ ] items will last throughout the balance of 2020.”

To understand his conclusion, you need to recall what you learned in your operations class about the logic of supply chains. The problem here is structural and driven efficient order scale and time lags. If your local toy retailer needs 100 Frozen II action figures in her store by November, her regional distributor—who services multiple retailers—orders 1,000 for October delivery. To fill that order, the national manufacturer orders 100,000 units from its oversees factory in June for August delivery. Time lags extend and order sizes grow the further you move back in the supply chain. If the retail community as a whole is uncertain about holiday sales, they delay their order as long as possible, or they don’t order at all.

All of this depresses traffic at the ports, which then impacts rail lines and trucking companies, warehouses, and local distributors and their workforces. As these people are uncertain about how all this will play out, they make fewer visits to the toy store, and a new set of dominos fall.

**Bottom Line**: look deeply at your own supply chain, and the supply chains of those you do business with. Whoever is ordering goods from across an ocean may see stock outs or delays in shipment, and that can affect your business in dramatic ways. Remember, for the want of a nail, the horse was lost, and for the want of a horse the battle was lost.

**$2.38 Trillion in Commercial Real Estate Lending at Risk**

The Coronacrisis lockdowns began in mid-March. Some homeowners and tenants, both residential and commercial, began worrying about April’s rent right away, while others had some cash flow to meet a couple month’s payments. Many people spent their stimulus checks on rent or housing expenses. Several states enacted laws that allowed people to get a forbearance on their rent or mortgage payment. Businesses, under the leadership of some clever real estate professionals, began to pressure landlords for relief or to renegotiate leases. Rent is a large, if not the largest, fixed expense for most businesses.

That pressure moved back into the system and landlords went to banks to modify their commercial real estate loans. Many banks offered relief through the summer. I heard from a number of bankers this week that landlords are now asking to modify loans through the end of 2020, or rework deals over a longer term. Retailers and other tenants continue to see constrained cash flow as consumers slowly wade back into shopping, dining out, or going to the gym. Hotels and leisure properties still see very little revenue coming in.

Office space looks fine for now as deep-pocketed tenants can meet their obligations; however, the long term looks fuzzy as no one knows what the final impact of our extended remote work experiment will be. Commercial loan modifications increase default risks, requiring banks to hold back more in loss reserves. The ripple effect of that risk means less cash, and less willingness to lend it, particularly to new or unknown customers.

**The bottom line**: If you are a stranger to your banker, change that now. The time and energy you spend in establishing, or deepening, a good working relationship with a bank will pay off in the ability to obtain funding. All else equal, known entities represent less risk when making lending decisions.

\
The lockdowns are ending, and people are returning to work and play. That activity represents a domino knocking over a new line of dominoes. There’s set of dominoes, like those we’ve mentioned here, that must all fall. Recovery is beginning, but there’s carnage that still needs to work its way through several industries. Don’t expect a “V” by fall, look for a “U” or a “check mark” recovery that persists through 2021 and into 2022.
