In the last post, I began to consider what reopening the economy might look like; will there be a slow but steady climb back to growth (a U), will consumers jump back into shopping outside the home (a V), or will we forever remain at a lower economic output as a nation (an L)? Some states are now three weeks into reopening, and, given time lags between reported cases and new confirmed cases (2.5 weeks), we don’t really know the public health impact yet.

New weekly claims for unemployment benefits continue to fall, but we’re not seeing a spike in return to work. One of my informal barometers of reopening progress, freeway congestion. The freeways are now busy, but yet to be congested. A good sign.

Last week I began some in-depth examination of the drivers of reopening and recovery. The first, and foremost, factor will be safety. People aren’t really going to engage in sustained out-of-home economic activity until they feel safe. This week I’ll continue that theme and talk about how the recovery will texture across the different geographies in the United States. Geography, and its close cousin demography, matters in ways we can see, and others we can’t. I’ll consider three different types of geography: Urban vs. rural, socio-economic, and age.

**The Role of Place**

If you look at the Coronavirus map in detail (click *[here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html)* to see a good one), the first thing that jumps out at you is the concentration of COVID-19 cases in urban and suburban centers. The eastern seaboard, the South and the Midwest have more affected counties that the West, and yet we can track similar patterns of case counts in urban areas in that region as well. Why does this matter? First, the breakdowns show us how and why COVID-19 has become politicized over the past month. If you live in rural America (a largely politically “red” area), then your personal confrontation with the virus tends to be more abstract and removed than people living in “blue” urban centers.

Second, and economically relevant, history teaches us that rural America has always followed urban America in terms of economic growth. Rural recovery will depend upon, follow, and track urban recovery. For the agricultural sector, the return of demand depends on the return of people in cities buying more than necessities. That’s true for domestic as well as export sales. For rural counties that live and die on tourism, those tourists come from urban and suburban centers. Bottom Line: Urban reopening precedes economic recovery for rural America.

**The Role of Income**

An article in The Atlantic noted that Black Americans are 3.5 times as likely to die from COVID-19 as White Americans. CNN reported that in California, Latinos made up 70% of Coronavirus deaths, but they are only 43% of the whole population. Many people have falsely accused these populations of engaging in “reckless” behavior, such as not wearing masks or not practicing. 

However, we have seen in the news that these decisions are not limited to minority Americans. These statistics, then, can be explained easily: African Americans and Latinos tend to be clustered in low wage jobs (either by choice or necessity, we will never really know).

Lower wage jobs disappear the earliest at any hint of a recession, or in this case, a virus. That’s why income levels actually rise at the beginning of a recession. Low wage, often unskilled, jobs were more likely to get laid off or furloughed (making the lockdown more economically traumatic), or these workers could not transition to remote work (you can’t build cars over the internet), which gave them greater exposure to the virus (making the virus itself more traumatic). Low wage workers often lack health insurance or access to care, meaning that when they finally seek treatment, they are sicker than others. Bottom line: the devastation is worse, and recovery will take longer in low wage communities.

**The Role of Age**

The CDC, and common sense, tells us that the older you are the greater risk you have of catching and dying from any disease, COVID-19 included. What’s important to remember here is that when we consider age more broadly, say people over 50, we often underestimate the economic impact of this group. The AARP reports that its membership, all Americans over age 50, represents the third-largest economy in the world, spending $8.3 trillion each year. Pre-retirees and the recently retired, have more disposable income than at any other time of their lives. Getting them out and spending will be crucial.

Age will also texture the recovery by area because older people tend to concentrate in certain areas of the country. While Florida comes to mind easily—Sumter county is the only county in the US with a median age above 65—a close look at a demographic map shows pockets of “seniority” in every state and region. This group may have the most to spend, but they also will be most hesitant about picking up discretionary spending. When this group fully re-engages, they’ll remove a huge break on recovery. Bottom line: Spending by older Americans is a canary in the coal mine for robust economic growth.

As your business thinks about reopening, look hard at your various “geographies”: physical, socio-economic, and age. The path of recovery for your business, and its longer-term growth, will depend on how well you understand and respond to the demographic and geographic texture of your key stakeholders.
