This post is the second in a series outlining the important questions of strategy that you can use as you begin to plan and budget for 2021. As I noted last week, the challenge of crafting strategy involves two key deep questions: where to go and how to get there. The first is the question of *formulating* strategy and the second is one of *implementing* it. Both questions matter and must be answered; however, they take a back seat to the first and most critical question: What is going on with our business right now? What’s going on here?

This question seems so difficult to answer in our COVID-19 reality. Things continually shift, and whatever trends appear don’t look good. Just this past week we’ve seen chances for more consumer and small business relief fade, and it’s likely that the airline industry will embark on a painful and long-term restructuring. Data on unemployment make the “v” recovery a naïve and simplistic memory. One headline I read claimed that now is “the beginning of the recession.” Vaccines appear delayed, an election looms, and things seem just as uncertain as ever.

Even though “what’s going on here” may be difficult to determine, three questions can provide concrete answers: Where are we today? What’s changed or changing? What is the right question we should be asking ourselves?

**Where are we today?**

What’s the situation? What’s our status as of today? Every executive should be able to answer this question by looking at both the financial and strategic income statement and balance sheet. Top line revenue is the first place to look. Year-over-year numbers may be almost meaningless because 2020 has been so different from 2019, but how did October compare to September? Pay attention to costs. Are they moving in the same direction as revenue? That’s good, even if the whole story isn’t great. Pay special attention to cash on hand, accounts receivable (which should not be aging) and accounts payable (which should be aging), as they determine your cash flow.

The strategic balance sheet focuses on the real capital accounts of the business: Cultural, human, intellectual, reputational, and social. For example, work from home has changed the culture and has likely impacted intellectual and social capital as well. Furloughs and layoffs have impacted human capital stocks, and the pandemic situation has probably slowed professional development and other activities that deepen human capital. Suppliers and customer relationships have changed as well, some are now stronger, but others have suffered.

**Bottom Line:** A clear and honest appraisal of your current position lays the foundation for all that follows. It may be painful to take stock, but the rewards will come in better planning, decision-making, and action.

**What’s changed (or changing)?**

When thinking about what’s different, it’s critical to differentiate between short term passing clouds (which you deal with operationally and tactically) and impending long-term storms. One major challenge for most executive teams has been balancing a focus on the short- and long-term perspective. Q2 saw most teams engaged in hand-to-hand combat to keep the business running and deal with the absolute volume of changes. All of that took mental energy, and short-term challenges will continue to require your focus. We are not out of the woods yet, and smart teams will identify 2-3 major short-term challenges to remain focused on over the next 1-3 quarters.

Over the longer run, it seems that we are all still learning to deal with a lasting coronavirus. What will be the long-term consequences of political shifts, technological innovation, or social changes on costs? On your ability to differentiate your products? Your ability to know and interact with customers and suppliers? Begin by mapping changes in the PEST forces (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological) that impact your suppliers, your customers, and your communities. Then trace these “adjacent” impacts back to your own business and you’ll begin to see potential shifts that may take 3-8 quarters to emerge. 

**Bottom Line:** Figuring out what’s different is hard work, and there will be a fair amount of speculation and interpolation. You’ll get some things wrong but take the time to make sure you are confident of the trajectory of the key drivers in your industry.

**So what?**

When asked how he was so successful, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky explained, “skate to where the puck is going, not where it’s been.” The answer to the first question tells you where you are, and the answer to the second tells you where the profitability “puck” in your industry is moving. The final question prepares you to craft strategy: What’s the gap between where we are and where the puck is going to be? The gap tells you how far you have to travel, and in which direction, to align your firm with shifts in the market. Strategies create value for firms to the extent that they align what your firm produces with what your suppliers can make and what your customers want.

The nature and size of the gap between the current and future market needs help you determine where to focus your strategic change efforts. For firms that rely on knowledge and intangible assets, gaps like working from home may be quite small, but the gap between current supply chains and future realities may be quite large. Some firms may find that they are already where the puck is going to be, and the goal is the strengthen the current position rather than moving.

**Bottom Line:** Asking the “so, what” question crystalizes the first critical exercise of strategic planning. It connects the dots between what’s going on today and what’s changing.

Most strategies will need to change to some degree. The challenge of making strategy under uncertain conditions is summarized in the Goldilocks problem: not making too many changes and not making too few. Beginning the process by asking “what’s going on here?” helps leaders calibrate how much, and where, strategy needs to shift to align with emerging realities.
