The last set of posts took up the issue of mental maps/ traps that must be adjusted/ abandoned to thrive and flourish in a world of strategic risk and uncertainty. It’s time to move on and get ready for 2021; it’s Q4, the final frame of what’s been a truly unique and wacky year. Q4 means different things depending on your industry. For retailers, Q4 is pedal-to-the-medal to make money over the Holiday shopping season. For consultants and financial services, Q4 is performance review and bonus allocation time. For most businesses, Q4 is about strategy reviews and setting budgets for 2021.

This month I’ll focus on the essentials of strategy, but not what you were taught in B-school or read about in the popular press. Real strategy is not about academic models or a collection of war stories of successful executives; it’s a series of questions that every executive team must answer. Sometimes those answers will be informed by solid academic models and data-driven research, other times personal histories and war stories will add tremendous insight. I’ll begin this series by describing what strategy is not and outline the core of what successful strategy really is. I’ll conclude with the three key questions every strategic leader must answer, which will become the basis for this month’s posts.

**Strategy is not a goal, it’s a set of resource allocation decisions.**

My colleague David Kryscynski uses the example of Hannibal, the ancient general who defeated Rome with his Elephant transported army. Hannibal’s *goal* was to defeat Rome, but that wasn’t his *strategy*. Things like missions, visions, goals, and objectives play a critical role in the strategy process because they establish the desired direction, motivate people to act, and sometimes (through things like core values) tell people how to act. None of these things, however, constitutes strategy. The goal to beat Rome set a clear direction and a measurable outcome, it certainly motivated his troops, and values like bravery, courage, and persistence all helped, but help is not strategy.

How did Hannibal win? By allocating his resources (routes of travel, supplies, troop strength) in a way that surprised the Romans and led to victory. For businesses, strategy is the set of integrated decisions over time that allocate resources in a coherent pattern that leads to victory in the marketplace. Real strategy is the opposite of high minded missions, it’s the detailed work of making choices, think budgets, cap ex plans, and hiring decisions, that result in a competitive advantage, a decisive and unique competitive position and product/service offering that competitors can’t imitate.

**Bottom line:** The high-minded goals of strategy come alive through the very mundane processes of making budgets, buying and selling assets, and building human capital in the business. In a real sense, these processes are the heart of strategy.

**Strategy can’t be “stupid,” it’s a very smart set of tradeoffs.**

I participated in a webcast this week with strategy guru Roger Martin, ex-Monitor consultant and former Dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. He noted that much of what passes for strategy is actually non-sensical, or in his term “stupid.” It’s stupid because if you take seriously the alternative, or the choice not made, you get nothing. Think of a firm that says, “we win though customer intimacy.” What’s the opposite, the choice not taken? It’s customer indifference. No one wins by being indifferent their customers. So, customer intimacy isn’t, in itself, a strategy because it involves no tradeoff.

Here’s what does make sense and involve a real tradeoff: “our strategy is high-touch, relationship based, face-to-face customer intimacy.” That’s the strategy of long-time high-end retailer Nordstrom and it involves choosing to do one set of things and not another. Contrast Nordstrom with another Seattle company, Amazon. To me, Amazon’s statemen is “we win through customer intimacy based on targeted algorithms that present customers with things we think they’d like.” There’s a real tradeoff, investing in people vs. technology. For Nordstrom, those investments include compensation structures, a deeply embedded set of cultural norms, and attention to detail in store design and product merchandizing.

**Bottom line:** Good strategies are “smart.” Winning strategies force executives, and everyone in the organization, to make the hard tradeoff that create a clear strategic position and set of offerings. Those tradeoffs also make it difficult—sometimes impossible—for competitors to replicate the strategy.

**Strategy making involves answering three questions.**

As your organization begins to think about strategy for 2021 and beyond, and as you begin to make the real dollars and cents choices that make that strategy real, it’s a good time to step back and ask three fundamental questions: What’s going on here? (or it’s equivalent: What’s the truth in this situation?) Given what’s going on, what should we do? Finally, how do we make it happen? The first question is the analytical one and there is no doubt that executives who understand the truth of the current situation, and what’s changed, have a leg up on those who gloss over this question.

“What should we do?” is the question of synthesis and leads to a decision. Synthesis is, at it’s core, pretty simple: So what does all this analysis mean for how we win? It leads to a goal, direction, and motivation.

Th final question, “how do we make it happen?” is the question of leadership and implementation. It’s one thing to know what to do, another thing to do it. Executives who can answer this question, and actually make it happen, are true leaders; they transcend the work of mere managers.

In the coming weeks, we’ll consider each of these questions in more detail.

**Bottom Line**: Stay tuned.
