As the country lurches forward in the fits and starts we’re calling “reopening,” I’m surprised that people are surprised things aren’t moving more quickly. The New York Times ran a headline on 15 May about continued job losses without realizing that job loss is a lagging indicator. The journalists wondered why, if salons and restaurants were now open, were people still losing their jobs? I’m reminded of the Rule of 4 I learned from one of my colleagues: Ron Mitchell.

Ron studies and advises new start-up companies. The Rule of 4, technically known as Ron’s Rule of 4, throws cold water on some entrepreneurial hopes, but it comforts the level-headed. The Rule of 4 is pretty simple: it takes four times as long and costs four times as much as you think it will. Some groups today are wildly overconfident about re-opening. They need some cold water. Others need some reassurance that what we are seeing, and will see, follows some type of pattern.

**4 Times as Long**

Starting a new business, or restarting an economy, doesn’t follow a set recipe. Every start-up has unique, idiosyncratic features that defy a stock recipe for success. At the other end of the scale, restarting a $21 trillion dollar economy follows no playbook. We are building the bridge as we walk across it. Two underlying factors lengthen the time necessary for success.

Complexity and interconnections. In 2012, Apple wanted to produce its Mac laptops in Austin, Texas instead of China. The plan fell apart when the company realized that its ability to source the small screws that held the machines together—a seemingly trivial part of a computer—could only be sourced at the scale they needed in China. As we restart the economy, the sheer number of interconnections between industries and sectors means executives now see with clarity what has been opaque.

Time lags. Why can my daughter earn a double major in history and economics in four years while her brother took six to earn a math degree? It’s the difference between sequential and parallel interconnections. Algebra precedes differential equations, which precedes number theory. Three semesters. Ancient civilizations and post-World War II history can be taken in parallel. Car makers can’t open until parts makers do, who are waiting on components makers. The more sequential industrial production, the greater the impact of time lags.

**The bottom line:** Look at what you’ve overlooked during normal times. If you can simplify complex processes, you’ll move more quickly, and if you can run several processes in parallel, you’ll reduce lags.

**4 Times the Cost**

Complexity and time lags increase costs, but the reason we so radically underestimate total expenditures is that our forecast runs off the “having learned cost,” but in any new activity there are non-trivial learning costs. Costs increase in several ways but let’s focus on two deep drivers of learning related costs.

Experience Curves. The production of aircraft in World War II taught us about learning, or experience curves. Managers noticed that as production doubled, costs fell in predictable ways. Adam Smith wrote of the same phenomenon two centuries before when he noted that the makers of pins would become more productive as they focused intently on the task at hand. They’d figure out ways to do their work more efficiently, they’d perfected processes already in place. They’d learned to be more efficient. Adjusting to social distancing, wearing masks, and interacting with each other will take some learning and perfecting, and we have to pay our way down that curve.

Discovery and innovation. Part of any new activity includes honing what we already do well while another part requires that we close knowledge gaps. We have to learn new stuff, and that costs money. Just like we had to pay tuition in college, we must pay tuition to learn any activity. Trial and error takes time, but those trials also require outlays of capital. Moving from a prototype to a beta-test version incurs real costs, and then we’ve got to learn to produce at scale. Shifting production from auto parts to ventilators required Ford and others to create unique configurations of their production lines. All this costs money.

**Bottom Line:** Expect to pay tuition as you reopen. There will be lots of trial and error, from opening times to lobby configurations. You’ll save money if you can look to others and “go to school” off them, but don’t budget based on the “having learned” cost. Expect to pay to learn.

Three overarching principles will help as you navigate the challenges of reopening: Flexibility, patience, and hope. You’ve tried to think through the major issues of reopening, but you’ve likely missed key interrelationships in your business. When you find them, figure out ways to adjust. Simplify where you can and try low cost solutions. Prove the Rule of 4 wrong where you can. Be patient. You may solve problems before other stakeholders, so share what you can and be patient through the process. Finally, remain hopeful. You’re smart, so are your people. Things will get better over time!
