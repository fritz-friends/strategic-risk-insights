I love to hike. There’s an interesting challenge that all hikers face when we want to ascend some lofty peak: we have to get through the foothills first. The problem is that the foothills obscure the peak; sometimes those foothills can be treacherous enough that we lose our way. That most often happens as we face big boulders, thick underbrush, or ravines during our journey through the foothills. We lose our way when we look for the easiest and most convenient way, but what seems easy often makes our ultimate journey harder and longer.

The economic restart we’re beginning is just like those foothills. They looked easy to climb from afar (remember the predictions of the “V” shaped downturn—quick in and quick out?), but when we get going, we face a series of hurdles, tough choices, and uncertainty that can lead us astray. In what follows, I’ll discuss three powerful tools to help: Having the right goal in the front of your mind, consulting a good map, and using the best compass available.

**The Right Goal**

Elihu Goldratt changed the world of operations management with his book The Goal. The protagonist, Alex, must improve productivity at one of his company’s production facilities in order to save the plant. Alex crosses paths with one of his old college professors, Jonah, who spends the book tutoring Alex on how to save the plant. Alex sees problems with inputs, throughputs, and all sorts of efficiency issues around the plant. Jonah helps him prioritize by teaching him the goal of the plant is not to make product, but to make money.

As I’m looking around as my state starts to re-open, I’m seeing smart businesses focused on the goal of profitability as they ponder if, when, and how to reopen. My favorite local burger place made a pretty effective shift to drive-through service over the last six weeks. They don’t want to reopen the dining room, however, because they (correctly) worry about two critical costs: the real costs of increased labor and food, and the reputational cost that would come if they’re connected with a second Coronavirus spike.

**Bottom line:** Reopening isn’t just about making money today; it’s about opening in a way that allows you to money over the long term. Smart business leaders will act with an abundance of caution as they restart. Gaining a reputation for being uncaring or reckless won’t help your business over the long haul.

**A Good Map**

If the destination or goal is profit, then the map is strategy. Your strategy isn’t to turn a profit, your strategy is a set of coordinated actions that help you do just that. Profit is the destination; strategy is the roadmap that gets you there. The basic question of strategy is “how do we create value for our customers or clients?” Businesses create that value in one of two ways: saving customers money or providing them with a differentiated product they can’t get anywhere else.

It seems as if the low-cost/ price strategies are having an easier, but not simple, time. Mot of these outlets have done little to change store layouts, remerchandise, or make efforts to encourage social distancing. The real challenge for the cost leaders will be getting enough volume at low margins to turn a profit. Companies that rely on customer relationships, product quality, or brand power have taken a much more cautious approach. They’re focused on attracting the right numbers of the right customers. They’re nervous about any action that threatens the core of their customer relationship.

**Bottom line:** Reopen in a way that not only preserves your strategy but enhances it. If you compete on cost, then open sooner so you can capture volume from hesitant competitors. If quality, dependability, brand, or some other difference maker allows you to win with customers, tread lightly and make sure you meet the needs of your most demanding customers as you reopen.

**The Compass**

Compasses and maps go together; having one but not the other doesn’t work. Direction and location fit hand in glove for a hiker. Your business compass is the set of shared values that holds your coalition of stakeholders together. Values underlie strategy and enliven it. Values allow you to make the long-term investments that drive down costs or create unique differentiation for customers. Values give strategies time to mature.

What are the core values you share with each important stakeholder group? Reopening isn’t about letting one set of values trump the others, it’s about finding balance. My burger place, as a family run company, puts employee safety at the top of the list. They’ve found a way to keep their employees safe while still meeting customer needs for great food, delivered hot and fresh. They’ll open their dining room when customers and employees will all feel safe.

**Bottom line:** Your core, shared values with each stakeholder group provide a set of guardrails for you as you navigate the current challenge. They don’t necessarily tell you which part of the trail to take, but they will help you see where not to go. That’s worth a lot, because n today’s environment, not getting it wrong may matter more than getting it right.
