This post is our third and final post pondering the texture of the economic recovery. It now appears that the hoped-for “V” (quick in, quick out) recovery won’t be the case. The most likely candidates as communities, states, and the nation presses into “reopening” appear to be the “W”—a future filled with periods of ups and downs. For this week’s post, I’m going to focus on two industries that will be outliers—one the forward-slash of sustained upward growth, and one “L” industry that should see a long-term reduction in capacity.

Looking at outliers can help your business think through potential short-term impacts to your supply chains and operations, to the extent that your business intersects with these industries. These outliers can also help you see longer-term, strategic ways in which the underlying forces that drive the shape and texture of industry-level recovery will impact your competitive advantage.

**The Big Winner: Technology Industries**

Here’s some data to look at the performance of technology companies. The S&P 500 Index hit its 2020 high on February 19th at 3388 points. The trough hit on March 20th when the index closed at 2304, down 32%. As of Friday June 5th, the S&P closed at 3193, for an increase of 39% or a total Coronacrisis loss to date of 5.75%. By comparison, the NASDAQ 100 Technology Index hit its pre-crisis high of 5954 points on February 19th, the same day as the S&P. It also hit its low on March 20th (which reflects the massive uncertainty in the market) at 4030, for an identical loss of 32%. On June 5th, the Tech 100 had gained 47% from its trough to close at 5917, representing a total loss of only 0.6%. Both indexes took the same initial hit, but investors seem far more confident in technology stocks. Why?

Two answers present themselves. On the demand side, tech of all sorts (hardware, online platforms, and software) all enjoyed steady, if not increasing demand. On the supply side, technology companies make heavy investments in what I call “portable” assets: human skill and knowledge. That allowed their workers to be productive anywhere they could use their brains (and had an internet connection). Those assets are also flexible and easy to change through adaptive learning.

**Bottom Line:** To the extent that your business looks like a tech company, both in terms of demand and how you supply your product, the quicker and more sustained your recovery will be. How much of your demand is for core products vs. customized or niche products? Core demand will drive recovery. On the supply side, what’s your investment in portable and flexible human assets? The more you invest in your people, and the better they prove able to adapt to changes in the market, the more your recovery will look like an upward forward slash.

**The Big Loser: Travel Industries**

We know how investors thought about the market in general, now let’s look at the performance of bellwether travel-related stocks: airlines and hotels. Both indexes hit their highs much earlier, Airlines on February 12th at 273 points and hotels on December 27th (just as news of the first outbreak hit in Wuhan) at 115 points. Hotels bottomed out on March 18th at 36 (down 69%), airlines reached their trough of 92 (down 66%) just a month ago on May 15th. As of Friday, the hotel index sat at 73, up 102% from the nadir but still down 36.5% on the year. Airlines have rebounded 78% to 164 but are down about 40% from the peak. These industries can look forward to an “L” shaped recovery, with permanently reduced volume. Why?

There are two supply-side issues here. The airline tracking website Upgraded Points notes that as of June 4th, 57% of global aircraft are now collecting mothballs. Both industries rely on “fixed” and inflexible assets much more than they rely on portable and flexible human talent. Because they are fixed, there really aren’t alternative uses for these assets without significant retooling. Airlines face a viable substitute in video conferencing, which will also drive down hotel occupancy rates among its most profitable customers, the price-insensitive business traveler.

**Bottom line:** To the extent that your revenue depends of fixed, inflexible assets, the more likely you are to see a long-term drop in demand. What’s your companies depreciation to wages ratio? Can you shed physical assets and replace them with human ones? The presence, or entry. of viable (read digital) substitutes to your products, the more likely your recovery may look like an “L,” or at best a very slow “swoosh” (the Nike symbol that looks like a softened check mark).

Some of these conclusions don’t seem surprising. Amazon is a big winner; in fact, the company will permanently hire many of the 100,000 people it added to its staff during the Pandemic. Delta, United, and by extension Boeing will struggle for years to come. You have some say in the whole matter of how your business responds over the medium- to long-term. The simplest strategy to pursue here is to invest in your people and look for ways to trade out fixed and inflexible ones for portable and adaptable ones.
