I listened to a lot of economists this week speculating about the nature and texture of recovery from the Coronacrisis. The key phrases were “unprecedented,” “record setting,” “light switch,” and other adjectives to describe the cratering of the US (and world) economy. One statistic highlighted that the US economy moved from the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years to the highest in 90 years. In one month.

Lots of talk about recovery and its “alphabet:” V, S, U, W, L, N, --, or /. Just to catch you up, here are what those terms mean:

**V**—Quick in, quick out.\
**S**—Short for Swoosh, the famous Nike symbol. Quick in and very slow climb out.\
**U**—Quick in, time in, and then a steady climb out.\
**W**—Quick in, quick rebound, then back in and back out (also known as a double dip).\
**L**—No recovery, a permanent downshift to reduced level of economic activity.\
**N**—An explosion of pent up demand, back down into recession, and then out.\
**\-- --**The dash, or no economic disruption at all, business as usual.\
**/**-- The forward slash, or upward movement and growth.

What struck me were two things. First, the focus was on the structure of the recession and not the drivers that would determine its ultimate shape, and second, the misguided belief that recovery would take a single shape. I’m an economist in much of my training, but I’m an industrial, or micro-economist. When I look at the variety of industries in the United States and their interconnections between them, I foresee each of these shapes as accurate for different markets. Rather than one shape defining the US economy, I see an alphabet soup of post-Coronavirus recovery across industries.

In the next three issues, I’ll discuss three elements which underlie the shape of recovery for an industry: Health and Safety, Geography, and Industry-level characteristics and structure. Let’s begin with the core driver of recovery across the economy: health and safety for consumers and workers.

**The core driver: Health and safety**

Some pundits and policy makers have portrayed the re-opening challenge as a tradeoff between human physical health and economic well-being. That’s simply false. The shape of the economic recovery depends on how safe workers and consumers feel when they leave their homes. If workers won’t work in meat plants or toilet paper production facilities, there will be no products for people to buy. For consumers, health and safety matters because consumer spending accounts for 70% of GDP, and if they don’t feel safe, they won’t go out and spend. Safety has three cascading components. My sense is that until we have all three firmly in place then we won’t see consumers open their wallets in ways that create real economic growth.

**Cleanliness**

McDonald’s announced a host of new rules to reassure customers that their dine in experience will be a clean and safe one; they’ll clean restrooms every 30 minutes, kiosks after each order, and pay special attention to cleaning high-touch surfaces such as door handles often. Southwest Airlines announced they’ll use hospital grade disinfectants to clean their planes each night. Face masks are a ubiquitous feature in most retail locations across the country. Steps like these reassure customers that companies are committed to making the buying experience a safe one. Bottom line: Worker productivity and customer spending will both increase in clean locations.

**Testing**

Testing has not been a bright spot in the Coronacrisis. We’ve seen problems with getting enough test kits to cover adequate numbers of people, and an April Cleveland Clinic study featured on NPR revealed that almost 1 in 6 tests yielded false results. Researchers used a rapid-test kit to examine samples from people previously testing positive. The rapid test confirmed only 85% of those samples. Until workers and consumers have confidence in the quantity and quality of testing being done, it’s unlikely that they’ll jump in with both feet and participate in the economy. Bottom line: Make sure your test kits are best-in-class, not just the cheapest or most convenient.

**Vaccine**

We saw good news on 18 May when Moderna announced positive results in Phase I trials. That’s one big hurdle down, but two more to go. The FDA will fast-track promising vaccines, but even when one comes to market, we’ll still have the problem of producing 330 million doses, and then we’ll need to inoculate that same number of people. Vaccinating the public will take months, not weeks. An effective vaccine will unleash consumer (and worker) confidence. Then, and only then, will business activity begin to look like the BC (Before Coronavirus) world. Bottom line: Mass events, such as sports, cruises, amusement parks, and theaters, won’t reappear until there’s a viable vaccine.

Industries where workers and consumers feel safe, such as online retail or technology in general, have seen either the forward slash (growth), the dash (stability), or the V recovery. For the rest of us, the focus today must be on cleaning, next quarter on testing, and next year on a vaccine.
