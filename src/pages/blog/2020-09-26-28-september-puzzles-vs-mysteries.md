I’ve been reading a great and incredibly timely book: *Radical Uncertainty: Decision-making beyond the numbers.* The authors, John Kay and Mervyn King. Their thesis is one that I resonate with, have written about, and will write about in the future. Risk is different than uncertainty, and the rules for solving problems of risk aren’t the same as for solving problems of uncertainty. They make a nice analogy in the book, and it’s the title of this week’s edition of the Advisor. Problems of risk are like a puzzle, while problems of uncertainty are like a mystery.

Risk’s signature calling card is that past experience guides and provides data to calculate the probability of future events. The first step involves identifying all sources of risk. This is analogous to turning over all the pieces of a puzzle before you start construction. The next step is to find similar past events as guide. Puzzle builders use the picture on the front of the box as a model, then they collect data as they sort pieces by color/shade and identify edge pieces. With this information in hand, it becomes a matter of trial and errors and simple hard work to assemble the puzzle. Risk managers use statistical models (trial and error) and judgment to arrive at their assessments of future probabilities.

**The nature of uncertainty as mystery**

Uncertainty’s hallmark is uniqueness. There are no similar events in the past that you can employ as a base data set. It’s futile to try and turn over all the pieces before beginning because all the pieces don’t yet exist. The causal structure of uncertainty, either in terms of causes or effects, are not completely known. This means, first and foremost, that solving mysteries requires a radically different approach than assembling the data and running models.

Mysteries also differ from puzzles in that there’s no “picture on the front of the box” for the problem solver to consult, and there are no edge pieces. Many wise leaders realized early on in the pandemic that the future would look radically different than the past. It’s not a case of returning to “normal,” but one of constructing and noticing the emerging “new normal.” Leaders go awry when they paint very clear futures because the real future may only vaguely resemble the picture. The search for edge pieces encourages poor leaders to arbitrarily designate some pieces/events as the “edge” and they work on solving a small part of a very large problem.

First and foremost, however, solving mysteries requires two important emotional skills: patience and tolerance for the discomfort that accompanies uncertainty. You’ll need to work on patience and tolerance on your own, so I’ll focus here on the cognitive elements of solving mysteries, avoiding the false certainty of numbers, and building logically coherent narratives of potential outcomes.

**Avoid the illusory uncertainty of numbers**

I’ve written about this before and for me it’s the best example of the illusory certainty of numbers during the pandemic. What does a positive case of COVID-19 really mean? Factually, it means the sum total of all people who have been tested for the novel coronavirus and received a positive result. Anything beyond that is unclear. For example, the number of positive cases should not be confused with the number of people infected because there are many, perhaps 4-5X more people, who have been infected with the coronavirus but absent any (severe) symptoms, have not been tested. We are learning that it doesn’t even mean “people resistant to future infection,” as there are reported cases of coronavirus “second-timers.”

For those solving mysteries, numbers are as likely to mislead as to inform. The key here is to go beyond the numbers, or more accurately, to go behind them. The question I raised above is helpful: What does this number really mean? What’s in the number, and what’s not? Where do the numbers come from and how reliable are both the sources and collectors of those numbers? It’s not that numbers are false; they just aren’t always telling you the truth you need to hear.

**Create stories to capture possibilities**

Lucky for us, numerical and statistical analysis is not the only way to solve problems. We have narrative, logic driven reasoning as well. The law relies on the use of words to make a compelling argument as to why something is possible, plausible, and even probable. Lawyers invoke the past in terms of precedent, clearly articulate how the precedent speaks to the case at hand, and point out where gaps exist between the current case and precedent. With that foundation, they argue for a range of possible outcomes that would be consistent with precedent but also close gaps.

Solving business mysteries requires the same type of detailed narrative analysis. How is, for example, the coronavirus *similar* to the 1918 flu pandemic, or the Ebola epidemics so common in Africa? How is the current situation *different* from the past? What gaps in potential responses do those differences expose? It’s easy to think that past solutions will work, but wise decision-makers pay close attention to differences and the gaps they suggest. They create narratives or stories about potential ways of filling those gaps. They use the principles of logic to test the coherence, robustness, and validity of potential outcomes. After testing and tweaking stories, they commit to a reasonable course of action.

Today’s world is highly uncertain and full of mystery. The tools that help you solve puzzles won’t help much. You need a different set of tools and a different mindset to solve the mysteries that abound around us.
