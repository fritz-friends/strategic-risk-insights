**Question**: What currents will be the most valuable as companies restart?

**Answer**: The ability of people to problem solve. All of us want certainty, and we’ll do anything we can to avoid the unknown. When we have to, however, we’re all really good at problem-solving. As I’m planning for my future, I’m not trying to see the “big picture” of 6-8 months from now. I know the peaks are there, but I’m focused now on climbing the hills just ahead. I have a general direction and can adjust on the fly to climb over the rocks, around the trees, and through the ravines. Trust your people to do the same.

**Question**: How does my mission help?

**Answer**: Our mission is about helping organizations flourish. In our work that means keeping our eyes on what creates real value for our clients. We try and focus on meeting their needs of today while helping them focus on a challenging, but ultimately brighter, tomorrow. So, we listen to our clients as they work through todays problems and concerns, and we hope we provide clear thinking about getting to tomorrow. We try to ask insightful questions that connect the present and the future for them. We help them define, focus on, an translate their mission to identify the path from the current situation to a better future.

**Question**: What are we doing to nurture relationships?

**Answer**: We’re doing three things. First, reaching out to express our concern. I have valued clients in New York City, and I reached out with expressions of sympathy and hope as they moved through the eye of the Coronavirus storm. Those human expressions mean a lot. Second, we listen. Each person and each organization has their own customized set of problems in getting through the Coronacrisis. We seek to understand what our clients really face, and how they define the problems in front of them before we offer anything like advice. Finally, we ask lots of questions about how they perceive their options moving forward. Rather than tell them what we think they ought to do, we suggest questions they may not have thought about or ask about the viability of options they haven’t considered.

**Question**: What data do we rely on?

**Answer**: We’re looking at local data, and how people are changing their behavior. One place I’m looking at is my favorite burger joint. They’ve done a nice job of downscaling and moving their business away from the dining room and to the drive through. I’ve noted with interest that they’ve avoided a “rush to re-open.” My last trip there took place after some restrictions were lifted, but it seems that they’ve decided that the marginal revenue they’d get from customers in the dining room wouldn’t offset the real and reputational costs of creating that revenue. We’re not looking to CNN or the New York Times for information, we’re looking to local businesses, parks, gyms, and stores. Local data drives local action, which for us and our business matters a lot because each of our clients has their own “localness.”
