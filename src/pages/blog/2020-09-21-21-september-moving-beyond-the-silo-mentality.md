This week I’ll continue reviewing mindsets that need to change if your organization is to flourish in a turbulent and changing world. Let’s attack a mindset that’s ubiquitous in large organizations, common in medium-sized ones, and far to prevalent even in small businesses. The problem is the Silo mentality, the tendency we have to isolate ourselves within our work function, prioritize the interests of our group above the business as a whole, and refuse to share information and knowledge with people in other silos. In its extreme form, the silo mentality teaches us to view other work units as enemies and kills collaboration.

If you’ve traveled much in rural America, particularly the Midwest, you’ve seen Silos. They are tall, circular towers for storing grain. Silos have many advantages. They provide an economy of scale in getting the work of storing grain and it’s easier to transport out of a silo. The circular shape is the most efficient use of space, and it helps prevent rot and other problems. Poorly constructed silos can’t handle the pressure and heat of all the weight, and poorly managed silos see grain ruined through moisture, mold, or pests. I’ll let you extend the analogy to your own organization, and I’ll focus on two elements of silos that prove deadly in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world.

**Deep efficiency vs. broad effectiveness**

The big advantage of a silo is the efficiency, and often effectiveness, of having people with the same skills and work tasks all together. They can collaborate more easily, they create their own economies of scale, and when managed well, a specialized work group creates a synergy that raises the overall quality of output. The best silos are much deeper than wide, and it’s the depth that creates all the advantages. Depth means greater specialization, which allows each silo to better serve their relevant niches. In a stable environment, the natural features of silos generate competitive advantages through lower relative costs and more differentiated outputs.

In turbulent environments—the ones we all operate in today—depth can easily transform into a competitive disadvantage. When markets and industries are in turmoil, those small, profitable niches that generated so much advantage tend to disappear, and buyers focus more on generalizable products and outputs. Depth becomes less valuable; breadth becomes more valuable. Survival in a harsh world depends on people working effectively across silos, often seeing new opportunities that arise where two traditional niches intersect. Businesses that can adapt and service these emerging, and more generic needs are the ones that prosper.

**Bottom line:** The strength of niches, their depth and efficiency, have turned into weaknesses. To survive and thrive, leaders need to break down those silos to serve changing customer needs—needs that require more collaboration and cooperation.

**Limited vision vs. diverse perspectives**

Silos group like things together and that creates many of the advantages we’ve noted above. When you group like things, you don’t include unlike things which creates a “diversity tax,” the loss of effectiveness that comes as perspectives narrow, mindsets harden, and what were once fresh insights become old and stale mantras. People who live in silos trust and respect others in their silo but often distrust and disrespect people who hold views different than theirs. To mix metaphors, but to invoke a powerful image from the world of social media, people who reside in silos also live an “echo chamber” where they are exposed to ideas and opinions they already hold and their world view becomes hardened and difficult to change.

One aspect of a VUCA world is a lot of information and feedback that’s inconsistent with the echo chamber mentality prevalent in organizational silos. People in marketing, for example, have a hard time reading market signals because those signals contradict the received wisdom of the group; however, for someone in the finance function, that information is easier to interpret because they don’t use the same filters as marketing. To be sure, finance has its own echo chamber, and no one sees the world as it really is. No one may see it, but a team of people with diverse perspectives usually see the new situation with greater clarity. The efficiency of a single world view ceases to create advantage; the ability to bring a diverse set of perspectives to bear on a new problem creates a huge advantage. Diverse perspectives help leaders answer a fundamental question: what’s really going on here.

**Bottom Line:** Get people out of silos by creating cross functional teams to assess changes in the many markets where the firm operates. You’ll get a much clearer sense of what’s going on, and the diversity of perspectives will help capture critical uncertainties that no one understands.

The mindset of the silo worked in the 1950s, a much simpler and more bucolic time. Silos had outlived their usefulness by the 1980s, when digitization and globalization began shaking up economies and societies. Companies trapped in a silo mindset today will have an increasingly difficult time against competitors who have busted silos and opted for breadth of interaction and diversity of perspectives.
