I’m back from the Holiday, and with the current Coronavirus surge, I’ve decided to rename this post. As you’ll read below, the Coronavirus is here to stay for the next several years. It will become a stable feature in how your run your business—it’s moving from a short-term uncertainty to a long-term strategic risk. To thrive and move ahead, you no longer need an “update” on current conditions, but you need advice on how to move forward on a sustainable basis. What you also need is the ability to really plan for the future, to see around the next corner. Let’s begin by looking at the numbers.

**The numbers**

Coronavirus will cease to be a threat when one of two things happens: Herd immunity or a vaccine. Here are the numbers on herd immunity. As of today, about 60,000 new confirmed cases appear each day. I’ve heard figures that anywhere between 40% to 70% of the population must be infected to get to herd immunity. The data collected by John’s Hopkins University puts confirmed cases at just north of 3 million. There’s substantial uncertainty about how many “unconfirmed” cases there are, but some researchers estimate that’s 10X, or 30 million. That would put the total infected at 33 million.

To get to herd immunity at 40%, that’s 132 million infected people. Let’s assume that infection rates rise to 100,000 per day. At that rate, it will take 3.6 years to get to herd immunity. If you take the 70% number, it’ll be 2027 before we hit herd immunity. I’ll return to the economic consequences of that in a moment. But first, let’s talk about the death toll. We’ve lost 133,000 fellow citizens so far. By the time we hit the 40% herd immunity level, we should see 528,000 total deaths. To put that in perspective, that’s 20,000 more people than died in our two deadliest wars (the Civil War and WWII). When we reach the 70% level, 924,000 of our brothers and sisters will have died: 50% more than the total American death toll in every war we’ve fought.

The data around a vaccine is also sobering. First, the likelihood of a vaccine in place before Fall 2021 is slim. We know so little about this virus, and the process of developing a vaccine just takes time. Then there’s the logistics of producing and distributing enough for 330 million people. Experts also wonder about the efficacy of a vaccine, and I’ve heard numbers anywhere from 30-60% of the population will be protected. If your vision is that we’ll all get a shot and then head to the bar to celebrate with friends, think again.

**Bottom Line:** prepare for a 2-3-year stint where wearing masks and maintaining social distancing are considered “normal” and prudent behavior. The Coronacrisis won’t end next quarter. Start thinking about decisions in a longer-term context, we are beyond short term adjustments.

**The economics**

Back in late March I wrote that having the US open for business by Easter was a pipe dream. We could expect a very slow opening by the Fourth of July. I got that part right, but what I got wrong was that shortly after the Fourth, we’d see the economy sputtering and potentially reclosing. If I’m half right, I’m still ahead of many economic prognosticators who got it all wrong.

We can all kiss the notion of a “V” recovery goodbye. The economic strength indicated by the falling unemployment rate is more illusory than real. Look behind the numbers and you’ll see that, while more Americans are back at work, more of the unemployed reported being permanently out of work. The trajectory of “working remotely to furloughed to laid off” is becoming a well-travelled pathway. 40% of the job gains have been in the travel and tourism sector, but I suspect we’ll see many of those folks back on the sidelines with the recent surge in cases. Finally, we’re facing a confluence of troubling timing as enhanced unemployment benefits and eviction/ foreclosure forbearances are all expiring at the same time. All of these will create headwinds that lengthen the recovery. .

**Bottom Line**: We aren’t in a depression, but this looks like a deep and prolonged recession. Government got us into this mess, and we’ll see whether they help us get out or make things worse.

**So what?**

Pay attention to your most critical stakeholders: customers and employees. The personal savings rate in the US hit 32% in April, a record by any stretch. With no where to shop, American’s saved. The rate is coming down, but slowly. That reflects both the slowness of the reopening, but also the fact that many customers—particularly high-income individuals—aren’t spending. They won’t until they feel safe. That’s job 1 for you.

Think hard about your employees. The current debates over reopening schools will impact your business more than you can imagine because it 1) creates uncertainty for every parent of school age kids (and that’s the majority of your work force), and 2) it will disrupt their lives; the only question is how big and how long will that disruption be. Productivity will decline. Employers need to think through how they’ll deal with their employees who will, in most cases, be forced to juggle working with parenting. Those that allow people to be successful employees and parents will build tremendous reservoirs of goodwill.

**Bottom Line**: As long as your key stakeholders are on shifting sands, your business will suffer. Make your customers feel safe and your employees supported, and you’ll see a quicker recovery and gain the benefits of greater loyalty.
