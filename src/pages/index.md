        “Kristina Narvaez is a wonderful resource for ERM. She has a great sense of its strategic applications, gained at least partially from her experience as an insurance agent, which many consultants lack. She is a very tireless and dedicated worker and willingly puts forth her best. Her academic credentials also gives her a great theoretical perspective that she balances well against her other practical experiences. While at Hanover Stone Solutions, she was a key founder and contributor using the above to help create a great foundation. She is just a great consultant.”
