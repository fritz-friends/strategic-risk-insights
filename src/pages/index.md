He has partnered with us on a number of projects over the years in support of companies who have committed to contribute 100% of their profits to charity a model innovated by Paul Newman when he first launched Newman’s Own in the 80’s.  Authoring several studies on the potential for growth in these companies, Dr. Godfrey has laid out a convincing case for the model and is a thought leader in the space. It is a pleasure to work with Dr. Godfrey as he is always a collaborative and insightful partner.”

        “Kristina Narvaez is a wonderful resource for ERM. She has a great sense of its strategic applications, gained at least partially from her experience as an insurance agent, which many consultants lack. She is a very tireless and dedicated worker and willingly puts forth her best. Her academic credentials also gives her a great theoretical perspective that she balances well against her other practical experiences. While at Hanover Stone Solutions, she was a key founder and contributor using the above to help create a great foundation. She is just a great consultant.”
